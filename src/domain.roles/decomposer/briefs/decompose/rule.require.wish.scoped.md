# wish.scoped

# severity = blocker

## .what
each proposed behavior needs a focused wish derived from the parent wish.

## .how
- extract the subset of parent wish relevant to this behavior's scope
- reframe in terms of this behavior's bounded context
- preserve the "why" motivation from parent
- make it self-contained (readable without parent context)

## .structure
scoped wish should answer:
1. what capability does this behavior enable?
2. why does this capability matter?
3. what is explicitly out of scope?

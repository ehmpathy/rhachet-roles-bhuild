## .what
behavior names must reflect domain concepts via ubiquitous language.

## .how
- use noun phrases that describe the capability (e.g., "user-auth", "invoice-generation")
- avoid technical terms unless the domain is technical
- prefer hyphen-separated lowercase (kebab-case)
- names should be self-explanatory without the wish

## .anti-patterns
- generic names like "phase-1", "part-a"
- implementation details like "database-setup"
- unclear abbreviations

- this wish $BEHAVIOR_DIR_REL/0.wish.md
- this vision $BEHAVIOR_DIR_REL/1.vision.md (if declared)

blackbox criteria = EXPERIENCE BOUNDS
- constraints on what users must experience
- if it's not needed for blackbox, it's not needed at all

declare ONLY:
- what inputs do users provide?
- what outputs do users receive?
- what usecases do users fulfill?
- what are the critical paths?
- what are the boundary/edge cases?

DO NOT include:
- mechanism details (what contracts/components exist)
- implementation details (how things are built)

note: blackbox is NOT "why to build" — that's the wish
      blackbox is "what experience must be delivered" to fulfill the wish

ensure to cover all experience bounds required to fulfill the wish and vision

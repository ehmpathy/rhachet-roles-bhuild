# iso-time/.behavior/v2026_01_04.iso-time/1.vision.src

help me flesh out the vision

for this wish .behavior/v2026_01_04.iso-time/0.wish.md

into .behavior/v2026_01_04.iso-time/1.vision.md

---

lets show examples of how the result would be used in the realworld

we want to testdrive the contract we're proposing

specifically highlight
- pros
- cons

and uncover anything awkward

---

# rhachet.vlad.brain-continue/.behavior/v2026_01_17.brains-cost-metrics/1.vision.src

help illustrate the vision implied in the wish

specifically,
- what would the experience of folks who use this look like?
  - what usecases? what goals?
- what contract inputs & outputs would they leverage?
  - what would it look like to leverage them?
- how would they talk about it?
  - what terms would they use?
  - what terms would we use?

what timelines would they go through?

how well does it solve the goals of the folks who use it?

a vision for how someone would use the outcome of the wish

show their usecases and the contracts they engage with

show the edgecases they'll have and how our contracts will keep them with
in a pit of success

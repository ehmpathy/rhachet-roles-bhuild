read how this pr was able to drop walltime of tests via the shards pattern

https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhrain/pull/21/files

gh ali read each diff in that pr to get the full context

---

we want to replicate that exact pattern in this repo for both
- integration tests
- acceptance tests

---

we want to have atleast 3 dynamic shards on the acceptance tests to start with

right now they take almost 7 minutes! way too much

ideally though, you'd be able to find which tests are the slowest and put them into their own shards explicitly

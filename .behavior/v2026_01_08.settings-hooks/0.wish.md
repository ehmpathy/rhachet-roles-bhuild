wish =

review the latest pattern via which rhachet-roles-ehmpathy instantiates hooks

gh api https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-ehmpathy/blob/main/src/domain.roles/mechanic/inits/init.claude.hooks.sh


wish = we want to update this repo to conform to that latest best practice

1. write to settings.json
2. use ./node_modules/.bin/rhachet run --init (instead of path)


longterm, we'll generalize that hook control interface into rhachet

but for now, lets replicate what rhachet-roles-ehmpathy domain.roles/mechanic uses

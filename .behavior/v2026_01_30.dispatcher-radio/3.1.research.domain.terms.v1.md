# research: domain terms

> what should we call the domain objects for dispatcher radio?

---

## objective

coin terms that:
- maximize specificity → eliminate ambiguity & minimize confusion
- maximize intuition → eliminate friction & maximize adoption

to create a ubiquitous language.

## 1. parallel domain analysis

### 1.1 radio dispatch (police/emergency)

> "police 10 codes were developed between 1937-1940 and were expanded in 1974 by the association of public-safety communications officials-international (apco) to make them briefer and to standardize message traffic." [1]

key terms:
- **dispatch** = send unit to assignment
- **10-4** = acknowledged, message received
- **10-7** = out of service
- **10-20** = location ("what's your 10-20?")

### 1.2 manufacturing / blue collar

> "a work order is also known as a job order, job ticket, work ticket, or service ticket - a document received by an organization from an external customer, or another department internal to that organization, to describe work to be completed." [2]

> "dispatchers need to track which techs are nearby, who's licensed for specific tasks, and whether the right parts are on hand before they release a job." [2]

key terms:
- **work order** / **job ticket** = unit of work
- **dispatch** = assign and release to worker
- **work request** = precursor to work order

### 1.3 restaurant kitchen

> "the expeditor (also known as an 'expo') is responsible for read orders to the kitchen from the ticket, check plate accuracy and ensure food goes out on time." [3]

> "fire/fire it: order given to start prep of food. 'fire those steaks.'" [3]

> "all day: the total quantity of a specific dish on order. 'there are 5 beef fillets, all day.'" [3]

> "bump it: to remove an order from the kitchen display system after it's been prepared." [3]

key terms:
- **ticket** / **chit** / **dupe** = order slip
- **fire** = start work on order
- **bump** = mark complete, remove from board
- **on deck** = next orders
- **in the window** = ready for pickup
- **heard** = acknowledged

### 1.4 healthcare

> "in clinical medicine, the term stat means 'immediately — without delay and with the highest priority.' stat is one of the core medical abbreviations used across prescriptions, lab orders, and nurse workflows." [4]

> "common types of medication orders include routine orders, one-time orders, stat orders (to be completed now), prn (as needed) orders, and titration orders." [4]

key terms:
- **stat** = immediate priority
- **order** = unit of work (medication order, lab order)
- **routine** = standard priority
- **prn** = as needed

### 1.5 logistics / freight

> "a waybill is a document issued by a carrier that acknowledges the receipt of goods by the carrier and the contract for shipment of a consignment of that cargo." [5]

> "a consignment note is also known as a bill of lading for transportation by road or boat and a cmr note in cross-border road transportation." [5]

key terms:
- **waybill** = document for goods in transit
- **consignment** = goods entrusted for delivery
- **manifest** = list of cargo
- **dispatch note** = air freight document

### 1.6 freight / truckers

> "a dispatcher is someone employed by a carrier that acts as the intermediary party between drivers and shippers to coordinate loads." [6]

> "a load board (also known as a freight match service or freight board) is an online marketplace that allows shippers and brokers to connect with carriers to move their freight." [6]

> "dedicated run or lane: a lane of freight that typically runs on a specified schedule at regular intervals." [6]

key terms:
- **load** = unit of freight
- **lane** = route between origin and destination
- **load board** = marketplace for loads
- **deadhead** = travel empty
- **dispatch** = assign load to driver

### 1.7 ham / cb radio

> "ptt stands for push-to-talk, which is typical of most mobile radio systems. when you press the ptt button, the radio ceases to listen and begins to transmit a signal." [7]

> "cq: a general call sent by a station to any other station that may receive it. hams and other stations 'call cq' to indicate they will answer any station that replies to their call." [7]

> "one-to-many: a term used to describe transmissions where a radio signal broadcast from one transmitter can be received by many receivers." [7]

key terms:
- **transmit** / **broadcast** = send signal
- **receive** / **copy** = get signal
- **ptt** = push-to-talk
- **cq** = general call for any receiver
- **channel** / **frequency** / **band** = communication path

## 2. term candidates

### 2.1 core entity: RadioTask

the unit of work broadcast via radio.

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| RadioTask | software | clear, descriptive | generic |
| RadioTicket | kitchen | vivid metaphor (chit on rail) | may imply support ticket |
| RadioOrder | healthcare | classic, formal | may imply sequence |
| RadioDispatch | truckers | action-focused | noun/verb confusion |
| RadioLoad | truckers | concrete, tangible | freight-specific |

**recommendation:** `RadioTask` — clear, generic, software-native. the "radio" prefix provides the domain context.

### 2.2 status enum: RadioTaskStatus

lifecycle states of a task.

#### QUEUED state

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| QUEUED | software | precise, queue metaphor | technical |
| PENDING | software | common, understood | vague |
| WAITING | general | simple | passive |
| ON_DECK | kitchen | vivid, next up | baseball metaphor leak |
| QUEUED | software | explicit queue | redundant with enqueued |

**recommendation:** `QUEUED` — precise, implies queue position, active state.

#### CLAIMED state

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| CLAIMED | software | ownership transfer | legal connotation |
| ASSIGNED | workflow | clear responsibility | passive (someone else assigns) |
| FIRED | kitchen | vivid, work started | may imply termination |
| DISPATCHED | truckers | sent to worker | implies transit, not work |
| IN_PROGRESS | software | explicit state | verbose |
| ACTIVE | software | simple | vague |

**recommendation:** `CLAIMED` — implies self-selection, ownership, active grab. aligns with "claim a task" natural language.

#### DELIVERED state

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|---------|---------------|------|------|
| DELIVERED | logistics | work handed off | implies physical goods |
| COMPLETED | software | work done | doesn't imply handoff |
| CLOSED | github | issue lifecycle | administrative feel |
| BUMPED | kitchen | removed from board | slang, unclear |
| FULFILLED | ecommerce | order satisfied | formal |
| DONE | general | simple | informal |

**recommendation:** `DELIVERED` — implies handoff to requester, work product transferred. stronger than "completed" which just means finished.

### 2.3 channel literal: RadioChannel

the communication path for task persistence.

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| RadioChannel | radio | frequency metaphor | abstract |
| RadioBand | radio | radio terminology | technical |
| RadioLane | truckers | route metaphor | freight-specific |
| RadioFrequency | radio | precise radio term | technical |
| RadioAdapter | software | pattern name | implementation detail |

**recommendation:** `RadioChannel` — intuitive, maps to "tune to a channel", supports future channels (slack, linear, notion).

### 2.4 repo literal: RadioTaskRepo

the target repository for dispatch.

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| RadioTaskRepo | github | clear, github-native | assumes git |
| RadioTaskTarget | software | generic | vague |
| RadioTaskDestination | logistics | metaphor | verbose |
| RadioTaskLane | truckers | route terminology | freight-specific |

**recommendation:** `RadioTaskRepo` — clear for current scope (git repos), can evolve if needed.

### 2.5 operations: push / pull

the verbs for send and receive.

#### push operation

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| push | git/radio | familiar, broadcast feel | overloaded (git push) |
| transmit | radio | precise radio term | verbose |
| broadcast | radio | one-to-many explicit | verbose |
| dispatch | truckers | send to worker | noun/verb confusion |
| fire | kitchen | start work | may imply termination |

**recommendation:** `push` — short, familiar, aligns with git mental model, "push a task" natural language.

#### pull operation

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| pull | git/radio | familiar, fetch feel | overloaded (git pull) |
| receive | radio | precise radio term | passive |
| tune | radio | channel metaphor | unfamiliar action |
| fetch | git | retrieve data | git-specific |
| copy | radio | received message | unclear |

**recommendation:** `pull` — short, familiar, aligns with git mental model, "pull a task" natural language.

## 3. proposed ubiquitous language

### 3.1 final term selections

| concept | term | rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| work unit | `RadioTask` | clear, software-native, radio-prefixed |
| lifecycle states | `RadioTaskStatus` | enum wrapper |
| state: created | `QUEUED` | queue metaphor, active |
| state: claimed | `CLAIMED` | self-selection, ownership |
| state: done | `DELIVERED` | handoff to requester |
| channel | `RadioChannel` | frequency metaphor |
| target repo | `RadioTaskRepo` | github-native |
| send action | `push` | git-familiar, broadcast |
| receive action | `pull` | git-familiar, tune in |
| idempotency | `IdempotencyMode` | database pattern |
| find-or-insert | `findsert` | project-specific portmanteau |
| update-or-insert | `upsert` | industry standard |

### 3.2 natural language mappings

| user says | system term |
|-----------|-------------|
| "send a task" | `radio.task.push` |
| "check for tasks" | `radio.task.pull --list` |
| "grab that task" | `push --status CLAIMED` |
| "mark it done" | `push --status DELIVERED` |
| "github tasks" | `--via gh.issues` |
| "local tasks" | `--via os.fileops` |

### 3.3 metaphor coherence

the radio metaphor maps consistently:

| radio concept | dispatcher radio |
|---------------|------------------|
| transmit | push task |
| receive | pull task |
| channel | gh.issues, os.fileops |
| broadcast | push to repo (many can receive) |
| tune in | pull --list (monitor channel) |
| acknowledge | claim (10-4, i got it) |
| sign off | deliver (transmission complete) |

---

## 4. alternative consideration: kitchen metaphor

the kitchen domain offers vivid alternatives:

| current | kitchen alternative | tradeoff |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| QUEUED | ON_DECK | more vivid, less technical |
| CLAIMED | FIRED | action-focused, but confuse risk |
| DELIVERED | BUMPED | slang, insider knowledge |
| push | CALL | "call the order" |
| pull | READ | "read the ticket" |

**verdict:** kitchen terms are vivid but require insider knowledge. radio + git terms are more universal for software audience.

# blocker.1

ensure that the tests are never able to use default github auto auth login

we never want to use the default env's auth for integration tests or acceptance tests



# blocker.2_

why are there no integration or acceptance tests that actually test against the DEMO_REPO?

why are there no issues created in that repo?

e.g., the acceptance test fixtures could actually set their upstream to that repo and test that by default they push radio.taskss to that repo

and we should also ave explicit --repo tests that taret that repo

we should not have ANY tests which target THIS repo's github issues


# blocker.3

why do none of the tests use the DEMO_GITHUB_TOKEN?

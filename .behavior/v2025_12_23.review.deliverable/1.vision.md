2. behavior is called 'v2025_12_23.get-weather-emoji`
3. behavior says "wish we had a procedure to fetch an emoji that represents the weather today"
4. behavior has a blueprint which declares how to do that at $BEHAVIOR_DIR_REL/3.3.blueprint.v1.i1.md
5. there's some git diffs unstaged and some git diffs committed on the branch, `feat/get-weather-emoji`

then

```sh
npx rhachet run --repo bhuild --skill review.deliverable --for.behavior get-weather-emoji --against blueprint
```

which will then invoke claude-code in non-interactive mode

and it will

1. open up the blueprint (filepath given to it deterministically)
2. open up the changes since main (i.e., the deliverable)

and review it against the blueprint

and then emit into


$BEHAVIOR_DIR_REL/7.1.review.behavior.per_blueprint.[feedback].v1.[given].by_robot.v1.md

the list of BLOCKERs and BLUEPRINTs

per template `.ref.[feedback].v1.[given].by_human.md`


-----

similarly

```sh
npx rhachet run --repo bhuild --skill review.deliverable --for.behavior get-weather-emoji --against wish,vision,criteria
```


should invoke that review against each of the wish and vision and criteria docs

and should emit into

$BEHAVIOR_DIR_REL/7.1.review.behavior.per_wish_vision_criteria.[feedback].v1.[given].by_robot.v1.md


-----

also, ideally,

should be able to invoke in --interactive mode

e.g.,

```ts
npx rhachet run --repo bhuild --skill review.deliverable --for.behavior get-weather-emoji --against blueprint --interactive
```


and see the claude code shell open up for us to be able to view its progress and subsequently interact

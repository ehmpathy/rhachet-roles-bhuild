rhachet-roles-bhrain just released a driver role with a `route.bind` skill

we want to use that skill to bind the .behavior dir we generated as the active route, since these behavior dirs are thought routes

---

in addition to binding that hook, we'd like to remove the 1.vision.md file, because it confuses the driver into thinking that the vision has already been completed

---

in addition to this, we'd like to setup .guard files at the following stones and rename .src -> .stone

so, add a guard at 

1.vision.guard 

which requires the human approval judge 

---

then add a guard at the blueprint stone

3.3.blueprint.guard 

which also requires human approval

---


lookup the docs on the `route.stone.*` skills from ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhrain to understand how it works and how to use it. (might be in the readme of the repo, but if not, just browse the source and emit a brief on it)

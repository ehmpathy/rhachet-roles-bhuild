# vision: catch.dream 🌙

## the outcome world

### day-in-the-life: before

you're deep in a debug session. the stack trace finally makes sense. you're about to fix it.

then it hits you — a vision for a thing completely unrelated. a better way to handle config. a feature that would delight users. a refactor that would make all the code cleaner.

you have three choices, all bad:

1. **stop and capture** — switch repos, install bhuild, run init.behavior, write the wish, lose your debug context, struggle to remember where you were
2. **quick note somewhere** — scribble in a random file, slack yourself, sticky note — it'll get lost, or you'll forget where you put it
3. **trust your memory** — "i'll remember this later" — you won't

dreams die in that moment. not because they weren't good. because capture costs too much.

### day-in-the-life: after

same scenario. deep in debug. vision strikes.

```sh
npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name "config-hot-reload"
```

your editor opens. you type three sentences. close the file. back to debug.

the dream is caught. `.dream/2026_01_27.config-hot-reload.dream.md` exists now. you didn't lose focus. you didn't lose the dream.

later — maybe tonight, maybe next week — you review your `.dream/` folder. some dreams were transient. some were gold. you weave the good ones into behaviors when you're ready.

### the aha moment

> "oh — i can dream *without* commitment to act on it right now"

the separation of **capture** from **action** is the unlock.

init.behavior creates pressure. it binds a branch. it sets up a thoughtroute. it says "we'll do this now."

catch.dream says "i saw something beautiful. i wrote it down. that's enough for now."


## user experience

### usecases

| goal                   | command                                 | outcome                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| catch a transient idea | `catch.dream --name "websocket-sync"`   | creates `.dream/2026_01_27.websocket-sync.dream.md`, opens for edit |
| add to a prior dream   | `catch.dream --name "websocket-sync"`   | finds prior file, opens for edit (no new file)                      |
| review dreams          | browse `.dream/` folder                 | see all dreams, sorted by date                                      |
| promote to behavior    | `init.behavior --name "websocket-sync"` | graduate the dream to a real thoughtroute                           |

### contract

```sh
npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name <dreamname> [--open <editor>]
```

**inputs:**
- `--name` (required): the dream identifier, kebab-case preferred
- `--open` (optional): editor to open with (codium, vim, zed, code)

**outputs:**
- findserts `.dream/$isodate.$dreamname.dream.md`
- if dream exists from a prior date, reuses that file (no duplicate)
- if `--open` provided, opens file in editor
- prints confirmation with file path
- if fuzzy matches exist from past week, prompts "related dreams found — reuse one instead?"

### example flows

**first capture:**
```sh
$ npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name "async-queue-batch" --open codium

🌙 dream caught
   ├─ .dream/2026_01_27.async-queue-batch.dream.md
   └─ opened in codium
```

**return to same dream:**
```sh
$ npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name "async-queue-batch" --open codium

🌙 dream found
   ├─ .dream/2026_01_27.async-queue-batch.dream.md
   └─ opened in codium
```

**weeks later, different day, same dream (no --open):**
```sh
$ npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name "async-queue-batch"

🌙 dream found
   ├─ .dream/2026_01_27.async-queue-batch.dream.md
   └─ tip: use --open to open the dream automatically
```

note: the date stays the same — it's when you *first* dreamed it, not when you last touched it.


**typo with fuzzy match (recent dreams):**
```sh
$ npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name "async-queu-batch" --open codium

🌙 dream caught
   ├─ .dream/2026_01_27.async-queu-batch.dream.md
   └─ opened in codium

💭 related dreams from past week
   ├─ 1. async-queue-batch (2026-01-25)
   ├─ 2. async-queue-retry (2026-01-24)
   └─ reuse? [1/2/n]:
```

- if user picks `1`:
  - if new file is empty → deletes new file, opens prior dream
  - if new file has content → asks "append to prior dream? [y/n]"
    - `y` → appends content to prior dream, deletes new file, opens prior dream
    - `n` → keeps both files, no change
- if user picks `n` → keeps new file, continues as normal
- prompt appears *after* editor opens — no latency on the happy path


### timelines

| phase    | duration       | what happens                                  |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| capture  | 5-15 seconds   | command runs, editor opens, type raw thoughts |
| incubate | hours to weeks | dream sits in `.dream/`, untouched            |
| review   | 5-10 minutes   | browse dreams, discard some, star others      |
| graduate | varies         | promote good dreams to init.behavior          |


## mental model

### the dream catcher

a dream catcher hangs above where you sleep. as dreams drift through the night, the web catches them — good dreams slide through the center and down the feathers to reach you; bad dreams get tangled in the web and dissolve with the morning light.

catch.dream works the same way:

| dream catcher        | catch.dream                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| the web              | `.dream/` folder — catches all dreams that pass  |
| the center hole      | graduation to init.behavior — good dreams pass through |
| the feathers         | the thoughtroute — carries the dream into reality |
| morning light        | review time — transient dreams fade, gold remains |
| the weaver           | the dreamer role — weaves dreams into a bigger picture |
| the night            | flow state — when visions arrive unbidden        |
| the moon 🌙          | the mascot — watches over the dreams             |

the act of catch is gentle. you don't analyze the dream. you don't judge it. you simply catch it before it fades, and trust the morning to sort the rest.

### how users describe this to a friend

> "it's like a dream journal for code ideas. when an idea hits me, i just catch it. no pressure to act on it. i can review my dreams later when i have headspace."

> "you know how you lose ideas in the shower? catch.dream is the waterproof notepad of software development."

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| dream journal   | captures transient visions without interpretation |
| pocket notebook | always there, quick to use, reviewed later        |
| voice memo      | capture raw, refine later                         |
| seed vault      | preserve potential, germinate when ready          |

## evaluation

### how well does it solve the goals?

| goal                           | score | notes                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| protect focus                  | ★★★★★ | 5-15 second capture, immediate return    |
| prevent forgotten dreams       | ★★★★★ | dreams persist in filesystem             |
| avoid premature prioritization | ★★★★★ | no branch bind, no thoughtroute pressure |
| enable future weave            | ★★★★☆ | `.dream/` folder ready for dreamer role  |

### pros

- **ultralight** — no setup, no bind, no ceremony
- **focus-preserves** — capture takes seconds, not minutes
- **non-committal** — dreams don't create pressure to act
- **discoverable** — all dreams in one folder, browsable
- **idempotent** — same dream name reuses same file
- **typo-tolerant** — fuzzy match prompt for recent dreams, after editor opens (no latency)

### cons

- **no structure** — dream files are freeform (maybe ok?)
- **no metadata** — no tags, priority, status (future dreamer role could add)
- **repo-local** — dreams live in one repo only (cross-repo dreams need thought)
- **no reminder** — dreams can be forgotten even after capture (future dreamer role could review)

### edge cases and pit of success

| edge case                         | how we handle                                                | pit of success                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| typo in dream name                | creates file, then prompts with fuzzy matches from past week | user can recover to prior dream without lost work |
| dream name with spaces            | convert to kebab-case                                        | automatic normalization keeps tidy                |
| dream name with special chars     | strip or error                                               | fail-fast on invalid names                        |
| run from outside repo             | error cleanly                                                | "no git repo found" message                       |
| `.dream/` doesn't exist           | create it                                                    | silent creation, no friction                      |
| same dream name, different repos  | each repo has its own `.dream/`                              | intentional: dreams are repo-scoped               |
| `--open` without editor installed | warn but succeed                                             | "⚠️ codium not found, file at: ..."                |

### what's awkward?

1. ~~**dream name match is exact**~~ — addressed via post-open fuzzy match prompt for recent dreams. no latency on happy path.

2. ~~**no dream template**~~ — addressed: file starts with `dream = ` (matches `wish =` pattern from init.behavior)

3. **repo-scoped only** — if you have a cross-repo dream, where does it go? could have a `~/.dreams/` global folder, but that's scope creep for v1.

4. **no graduation path (yet)** — catch is great, but graduate to init.behavior is manual. future dreamer role could offer `weave.dream` to promote.


## summary

catch.dream is the **waterproof notepad** of software development.

it lets builders dream without loss of focus.

it separates **capture** from **action**, so dreams don't die in the moment they're born.

wish =

wish we had a role called dreamer, within bhuild

who's responsibility is to dream the future we want to see

---

we can kick it off with a skill to `<catch.dream>`

e.g.,

`npx rhachet run --skill catch.dream --name` should persist to the `.dream/` directory

(similar to how init.behavior persists to the .behavior directory)

and it should supply the same semantics for `--open` as the init.behavior does too

however, what we want from it is to simply findsert one file, $isodate.$dreamName.dream.md

and if that dreamname already exists from prior, it should reuse it, and not create a new name

---

and what it should do is allow the user to catch their dream

just let them open that file and so they can immediately catch the dream. the wish or vision that they had. and get back to their prior focus


that way
- there's no risk of the dream forgotten afterwards, via non-capture
- there's no delay in attempts to catch the dream via init.behavior (find repo, install, init.behavior, finally write)
- there's no risk of the dream prioritized immediately, after init.behavior makes it so easy to fallthrough

---

that way, we can protect the focus of our builders

so they can dream. without the need to spend focus or time to catch that dream

---

in the future, these dreams can be woven together by the dreamer into a bigger picture; or prioritized by the dispatcher; etc

but this will start and enable us to catch them


use a moon emoji as the mascot of the dreamer; 🌙

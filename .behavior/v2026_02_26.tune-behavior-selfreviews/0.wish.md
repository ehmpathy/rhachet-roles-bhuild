❯ lets update the blueprint and execute self reviews in the behavior dir to be more of the frame                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  - review line by line for omissions in coverage and adherance against the behavior declaration's blueprint, criteria, and vision. a junior had touched this code since the last time you worked on it, so we need to be dilligent that they didn't introduce defects or omissions.  
  - review line by line for omissions in coverage and adherance against the mechanic standards. a junior had touched this code since the last time you worked on it, so we need to be dilligent they didn't introduce bad practices or forgot best practices.

specifically, there's self reviews in our extant init.behavior templates

they were phrased in an adhoc way

we want to standardize them on the more fundamental combinations of reviewables per 

- [$role][standards] x [[coverage], [adherance]] 

- [$behavior][declaration] x [[coverage], [adherance]]

# self-review: all-done-self

## question

are you sure all of the criteria and vision was covered?

## review

i slowed down and read through the wish, vision, and blueprint carefully, line by line.

---

### wish requirements check

the wish asks for:

1. **"standardize them on the more fundamental combinations of reviewables"**
   - `[$role][standards] x [[coverage], [adherance]]`
   - `[$behavior][declaration] x [[coverage], [adherance]]`

   ✓ blueprint defines the 2x2 frame with these exact 4 combinations
   ✓ blueprint shows the priority order
   ✓ blueprint includes full contract shape with all 4 reviews

2. **"self reviews in our extant init.behavior templates"**

   ✓ blueprint lists all 4 guard templates
   ✓ blueprint shows which to update (`[~]`) vs retain (`[○]`)

---

### vision requirements check

| vision section | requirement | covered? |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| outcome world | 2x2 frame diagram | ✓ blueprint summary has same diagram |
| outcome world | 4 canonical review types | ✓ codepaths section shows all 4 slugs |
| user experience | priority order | ✓ summary lists correct order |
| user experience | detailed say blocks | ✓ contracts section has full yaml |
| user experience | report paths to `.behavior/$thisBehavior/reviews/` | ✓ contracts and report paths sections |
| evaluation | allow subset for earlier stones | ✓ criteria retained with its specialized review |
| evaluation | default all 4 for execution stones | ✓ execution guard gets all 4 |

---

### criteria guard decision

i re-examined whether criteria guard should get the standardized frame.

the criteria guard has this review:
```yaml
- slug: all-real-junior
  say: a junior recently worked on this criteria. are there any unquestioned
       assumptions the junior took as requirements?
```

this review serves a **different purpose** than the 2x2 frame:
- 2x2 frame checks: coverage and adherance of implementation
- criteria review checks: validity of requirements themselves

the 2x2 frame is for stones where code is written against a declaration.
at criteria stage, we're defining the declaration itself - no code to check yet.

vision explicitly says: "allow subset for earlier stones (vision, criteria)"

**conclusion**: retain criteria as-is is the correct decision.

## gaps found

none.

## conclusion

i read each line of the wish, vision, and blueprint. the blueprint covers:
- the 2x2 frame from the wish
- all requirements from the vision
- correct treatment of each guard template

ready to proceed.

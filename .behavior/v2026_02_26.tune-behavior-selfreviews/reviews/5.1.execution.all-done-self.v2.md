# self-review: all-done-self (v2)

## question

are you sure all was completed? review the blueprint and criteria.

## review

i paused. took a breath. read the blueprint line by line. then checked each requirement against the implementation.

---

## blueprint section: filediffs

the blueprint specifies:
```
src/domain.operations/behavior/init/templates/
├── [~] 5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard   # replace adhoc reviews
├── [~] 3.3.blueprint.v1.guard                    # replace adhoc reviews
├── [○] 2.1.criteria.blackbox.guard               # retain
└── [○] 1.vision.guard                            # retain
```

### verification

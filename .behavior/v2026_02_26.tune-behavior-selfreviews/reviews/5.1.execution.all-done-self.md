## question

are you sure all was completed? review the blueprint and criteria. emit a report on gaps detected.

## review

i paused. took a breath. examined the work with stillness.

## blueprint phase-by-phase verification

### phase 1: update execution guard ✓

| task | done? | verification |
|------|-------|--------------|
| open execution guard template | ✓ | read file at src/.../5.1.execution...guard |
| remove all-done-self | ✓ | slug no longer present in template |
| remove all-done-junior | ✓ | slug no longer present in template |
| add 4 standardized reviews | ✓ | grep confirms 4 slugs: behavior.declaration.coverage, behavior.declaration.adherance, role.standards.adherance, role.standards.coverage |
| no judges section | ✓ | verified file ends after reviews |

### phase 2: update blueprint guard ✓

| task | done? | verification |
|------|-------|--------------|
| open blueprint guard template | ✓ | read file at src/.../3.3.blueprint...guard |
| remove all-done-self | ✓ | slug no longer present in template |
| remove all-done-junior | ✓ | slug no longer present in template |
| remove all-simple-junior | ✓ | slug no longer present in template |
| add 4 standardized reviews | ✓ | grep confirms 4 slugs |
| retain judges section | ✓ | verified judges section present |

### phase 3: verify build ✓

| task | done? | verification |
|------|-------|--------------|
| npm run build | ✓ | exit code 0 |
| guard files in dist/ | ✓ | verified via grep on dist/ |

### phase 4: test ✓

| task | done? | verification |
|------|-------|--------------|
| update test assertions | ✓ | changed all-done-self → behavior.declaration.coverage |
| update test promises | ✓ | all 4 new slugs in promise commands |
| npm run test:types | ✓ | exit code 0 |
| tests [t5], [t8] pass | ✓ | confirm new slugs shown in guard output |

## done criteria verification

| criterion | satisfied? | evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| execution guard has 4-review frame | ✓ | grep shows 4 standardized slugs |
| blueprint guard has 4-review frame | ✓ | grep shows 4 standardized slugs |
| build passes | ✓ | npm run build exit code 0 |
| tests pass | ✓ | type checks pass, [t5] and [t8] pass |

---

## gaps detected

none.

## conclusion

all phases of the blueprint are complete. all done criteria are satisfied. the implementation is finished.

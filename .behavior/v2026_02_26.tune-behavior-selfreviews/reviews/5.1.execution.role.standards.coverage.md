# self-review: role.standards.coverage

## question

review for coverage of mechanic role standards.

go through each file changed in this pr, line by line, and check for omitted patterns that should be present.

## review

i paused. took a breath. examined the implementation for omitted best practices.

---

### guard template files

guard templates are yaml configuration. the relevant standards to check:

| standard | present? | notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| header comments | ✓ | both files have explanatory headers |
| consistent format | ✓ | yaml structure matches extant patterns |
| no excess config | ✓ | only required fields present |

### test file changes

| standard | present? | notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| test coverage | ✓ | tests verify guard template content |
| snapshot tests | ✓ | snapshots capture full output |
| assertion tests | ✓ | explicit checks for slug names |
| error path tests | ✓ | tests verify blocked states |
| success path tests | ✓ | tests verify allowed states |

### what was NOT added (intentionally)

| omission | justified? | reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| new unit tests | ✓ | template content change, not behavior change |
| type definitions | ✓ | yaml templates, not typescript |
| validation logic | ✓ | templates are static config |
| error handlers | ✓ | templates consumed by bhrain, not this package |

### what COULD have been added

| consideration | decision | reason |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| yaml schema validation | not added | bhrain validates at runtime |
| template unit tests | not added | acceptance tests cover behavior |
| jsdoc comments | not added | yaml files, not typescript |

---

## gaps found

none. all relevant mechanic standards are applied. no patterns omitted that should be present.

---

## conclusion

the implementation covers all relevant mechanic role standards. no omissions detected.

# self-review: role.standards.adherance

## question

review for adherance to mechanic role standards.

go through each file changed in this pr, line by line, and check for violations of required patterns.

## review

i paused. took a breath. examined the implementation against mechanic standards.

---

### guard template files

guard templates are yaml configuration, not typescript code. mechanic standards for code patterns don't directly apply. however, i checked for:

| standard | adheres? | evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| clear structure | ✓ | yaml follows consistent indentation |
| readable comments | ✓ | header comments explain purpose |
| avoid over-engineer | ✓ | simple yaml structure, no complexity |
| single responsibility | ✓ | each review has one focused purpose |

### test file: skill.init.behavior.guards.acceptance.test.ts

| standard | adheres? | evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| given/when/then pattern | ✓ | tests use test-fns structure |
| clear test descriptions | ✓ | descriptive names for all tests |
| no mocks | ✓ | integration tests with real execution |
| single assertion focus | ✓ | each then block has focused assertions |
| comment discipline | ✓ | block comments explain test sections |
| arrow functions | ✓ | all callbacks use arrow syntax |
| no let mutations | ✓ | checkpoints object used consistently |

### general standards

| standard | adheres? | evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| prefer-wet-over-dry | ✓ | no premature abstractions in templates |
| fail-fast | n/a | templates are config, not logic |
| idempotency | n/a | templates are config, not mutations |
| lowercase prose | ✓ | all say blocks use lowercase |

## violations found

none. no anti-patterns, bad practices, or deviations from mechanic conventions detected.

---

## conclusion

the implementation adheres to mechanic role standards. no violations detected.

# self-review: all-simple-junior

## question

a junior recently worked on this blueprint. are there any parts that are needlessly over-complicated? any opportunities to simplify yet still fulfill the full vision and criteria?

## review

i paused. took a breath. examined the blueprint with stillness.

the question is: what is truly needless?

---

### the fundamental question

could the blueprint be shorter and still enable execution?

**minimum viable blueprint:**
```md
# blueprint
update 5.1.execution...guard and 3.3.blueprint...guard
to use the standardized 4-review frame from 1.vision.md
retain 2.1.criteria...guard and 1.vision.guard as-is
```

that's 4 lines. the vision already has the contract shape.

**why the actual blueprint is longer:**
1. contracts section adds judges (vision doesn't specify judges)
2. codepaths shows explicit diffs (reduces inference work)
3. report paths gives concrete examples (aids verification)
4. what changes summarizes in table form (quick reference)

each addition serves execution clarity, not vanity.

### section-by-section simplicity analysis

| section | lines | purpose | simplify? |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| summary | 1-23 | 2x2 frame + priority order | ✓ minimal, essential |
| filediffs | 26-34 | which files change | ✓ minimal, essential |
| codepaths | 38-58 | what changes within files | ? see analysis below |
| contracts | 62-148 | the actual yaml | ✓ required by vision |
| report output paths | 152-166 | where reports go | ? see analysis below |
| what changes | 170-177 | summary table | ✓ helpful overview |
| test coverage | 181-185 | test notes | ✓ minimal, essential |

---

### could codepaths section be removed?

the codepaths section shows:
```
5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard
├── [-] reviews.self[slug=all-done-self]
├── [-] reviews.self[slug=all-done-junior]
├── [+] reviews.self[slug=behavior.declaration.coverage]
...
```

this information is also derivable from:
- filediffs (which files change)
- contracts (what the new content looks like)

**analysis**: codepaths adds value by explicit diff (what's removed vs added). without it, the executor would need to infer this from contracts vs current templates.

**verdict**: keep codepaths - it reduces cognitive load at execution.

---

### could report output paths section be removed?

the report paths are derivable from the contracts section:
```yaml
emit your findings to .behavior/$thisBehavior/reviews/{stone}.behavior.declaration.coverage.md
```

the report output paths section just expands this pattern to show concrete examples.

**analysis**: the section is 14 lines. it provides a quick reference for what files will be created.

**verdict**: keep it - low cost, aids verification.

---

### is the contracts yaml too verbose?

the contracts section is 80 lines of yaml. each review has ~17 lines.

**analysis**: the vision explicitly requires detailed say blocks with:
- what to review
- junior detection language
- checklist items
- report path
- fix instruction

**verdict**: the verbosity is by design per vision requirements.

---

### is 4 reviews overkill for some guards?

the vision acknowledges this:
> **cons**
> - verbosity: 4 reviews instead of 1-2 adhoc prompts
> - overhead: may be excessive for simple stones

and addresses it:
> allow subset for earlier stones (vision, criteria)

the blueprint correctly:
- gives execution guard all 4 reviews (highest risk)
- gives blueprint guard all 4 reviews (defines implementation)
- retains criteria with specialized review
- retains vision with no reviews

**verdict**: appropriate - the 4-review overhead is accepted for execution and blueprint stones.

---

### what happened to `all-simple-junior`?

the current blueprint guard has `all-simple-junior` to check over-complication.

the new frame removes it. is this a gap?

**analysis**: simplicity checks are covered by `role.standards.adherance`:
- mechanic standards include "prefer-wet-over-dry", "avoid over-engineer"
- violations of simplicity patterns are caught by standards adherance

**verdict**: simplicity is subsumed into standards adherance. not a gap.

## opportunities to simplify - reconsidered

i paused and genuinely looked for ways to reduce.

### option 1: merge filediffs + codepaths

current structure:
```
## filediffs
├── [~] 5.1.execution...guard

## codepaths
5.1.execution...guard
├── [-] reviews.self[slug=all-done-self]
```

could become:
```
## changes
├── [~] 5.1.execution...guard
│   ├── [-] reviews.self[slug=all-done-self]
│   ...
```

**verdict**: possible but trades scannability for compactness. the current split lets you see "what files" vs "what inside files" at a glance. keeping separate is clearer.

### option 2: remove report output paths

the 8 example paths are derivable from `{stone}.{slug}.md` pattern in contracts.

**verdict**: true, but the explicit list serves as verification checklist. 14 lines is low cost for the clarity it adds.

### option 3: remove what changes table

the table duplicates info from filediffs + codepaths.

**verdict**: the table provides a quick summary without tree syntax. helpful for quick reference. low cost to keep.

---

## final assessment

i found 3 potential simplifications. each would save 10-20 lines but reduce clarity or scannability.

the blueprint uses ~186 lines. could be ~140 lines with aggressive trimming. but the extra ~46 lines serve readability.

**decision**: keep current structure. the "redundancy" is intentional - it makes the blueprint easier to navigate and verify.

---

## conclusion

the blueprint is organized, not complicated. each section serves a distinct purpose. the structure aids execution more than it costs in length.

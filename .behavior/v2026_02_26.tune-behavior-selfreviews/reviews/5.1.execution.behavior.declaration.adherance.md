# self-review: behavior.declaration.adherance

## question

review for adherance to the behavior declaration.

go through each file changed in this pr, line by line, and check against the behavior's vision, criteria, and blueprint.

## review

i paused. took a breath. examined the implementation line by line with stillness.

---

### file: 5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard

#### line-by-line check

| lines | content | adheres? | notes |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1-2 | header comment | ✓ | matches blueprint: "guard for execution stone" |
| 4-5 | reviews.self structure | ✓ | yaml format per vision contract |
| 6-7 | slug: behavior.declaration.coverage | ✓ | exact match to vision slug |
| 8-22 | say block for coverage | ✓ | matches vision contract shape |
| 24-25 | slug: behavior.declaration.adherance | ✓ | exact match to vision slug |
| 26-42 | say block for adherance | ✓ | matches vision contract shape |
| 44-45 | slug: role.standards.adherance | ✓ | exact match to vision slug |
| 46-58 | say block for standards adherance | ✓ | matches vision contract shape |
| 60-61 | slug: role.standards.coverage | ✓ | exact match to vision slug |
| 62-76 | say block for standards coverage | ✓ | matches vision contract shape |
| (end) | no judges section | ✓ | per blueprint: "execution guard doesn't require human approval" |

#### say block content check

each say block verified against vision contract shape:
- ✓ intro paragraph that describes what to review
- ✓ junior detection sentence
- ✓ checklist items with `-` bullets
- ✓ report path with correct pattern
- ✓ fix instruction

### file: 3.3.blueprint.v1.guard

#### line-by-line check

| lines | content | adheres? | notes |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1-2 | header comment | ✓ | includes "+ human approval" per blueprint |
| 4-5 | reviews.self structure | ✓ | yaml format per vision contract |
| 6-22 | coverage review | ✓ | references "vision and criteria" (not blueprint) |
| 24-40 | adherance review | ✓ | references "vision and criteria" (not blueprint) |
| 42-57 | standards adherance | ✓ | matches vision contract shape |
| 59-74 | standards coverage | ✓ | matches vision contract shape |
| 76-77 | judges section | ✓ | retained per blueprint |

#### key difference from execution guard

blueprint guard say blocks correctly reference:
- "go through the behavior's vision and criteria"
- "check against the behavior's vision and criteria"

execution guard say blocks correctly reference:
- "go through the behavior's vision, criteria, and blueprint"
- "check against the behavior's vision, criteria, and blueprint"

this adheres to blueprint spec: "blueprint guard references vision+criteria only"

### file: skill.init.behavior.guards.acceptance.test.ts

#### changes check

| change | adheres? | notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| comment update: "4 prompts" | ✓ | reflects new review count |
| promise commands use new slugs | ✓ | behavior.declaration.coverage, etc. |
| assertions check new slug | ✓ | changed from all-done-self to behavior.declaration.coverage |

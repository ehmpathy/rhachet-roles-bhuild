# self-review: all-done-junior

## question

a junior recently worked on this blueprint. review against the criteria and vision and flag any gaps detected.

## review

i slowed down and compared the blueprint against the vision, line by line.

---

### exact text comparison: contract shape

i opened both files side by side and compared the yaml blocks character by character.

**vision lines 87-157** vs **blueprint lines 74-144**:

| line | vision | blueprint | match? |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| slug 1 | `behavior.declaration.coverage` | `behavior.declaration.coverage` | ✓ |
| slug 2 | `behavior.declaration.adherance` | `behavior.declaration.adherance` | ✓ |
| slug 3 | `role.standards.adherance` | `role.standards.adherance` | ✓ |
| slug 4 | `role.standards.coverage` | `role.standards.coverage` | ✓ |

say blocks for each review:
- ✓ same intro paragraph
- ✓ same junior detection sentence
- ✓ same checklist items
- ✓ same report path pattern
- ✓ same "fix gaps before you continue" instruction

---

### judges section check

the blueprint contracts section includes:
```yaml
judges:
  - npx rhachet run --repo bhrain --skill route.stone.judge --mechanism approved? --stone $stone --route $route
```

the vision contract shape does NOT include judges. is this a gap?

check the codepaths section:
- `3.3.blueprint.v1.guard` → `[○] judges[mechanism=approved?]` (retain)
- `5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard` → no judges listed

this is correct because:
- current blueprint guard has judges (human approval)
- current execution guard does not have judges

the contracts section in blueprint shows judges as part of the generic template.
the codepaths section clarifies which guards actually have judges.

✓ not a gap - just context-specific adaptation

---

### priority order check

vision summary (lines 18-22):
```
priority order:
1. behavior.declaration.coverage
2. behavior.declaration.adherance
3. role.standards.adherance
4. role.standards.coverage
```

blueprint summary (lines 18-22):
```
priority order:
1. `behavior.declaration.coverage`
2. `behavior.declaration.adherance`
3. `role.standards.adherance`
4. `role.standards.coverage`
```

✓ exact match (just format difference with backticks)

---

### filediffs accuracy check

blueprint filediffs claims:
- `[~] 5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard` - has 2 adhoc reviews
- `[~] 3.3.blueprint.v1.guard` - has 3 adhoc reviews

verified against actual templates:
- `5.1.execution...guard`: has `all-done-self`, `all-done-junior` → 2 reviews ✓
- `3.3.blueprint...guard`: has `all-done-self`, `all-done-junior`, `all-simple-junior` → 3 reviews ✓

---

### what changes table accuracy

| file | blueprint says before | actual before | match? |
|------|----------------------|---------------|--------|
| execution | 2 adhoc reviews | 2 | ✓ |
| blueprint | 3 adhoc reviews | 3 | ✓ |
| criteria | 1 specific review | 1 | ✓ |
| vision | no self-reviews | none | ✓ |

---

## gaps found

none. i compared:
1. contract shape yaml - exact match
2. priority order - exact match
3. filediffs claims vs actual templates - accurate
4. judges section - correctly differentiated per guard
5. what changes table - accurate

---

## conclusion

the blueprint accurately reflects the vision. no junior mistakes detected.

# self-review: all-done-junior (detailed review v2)

## question

a junior recently worked on this branch. review against the blueprint and criteria and flag any gaps detected.

## review

i paused. took a breath. read the blueprint and implementation line by line with fresh eyes.

## blueprint vs implementation comparison

### blueprint says (lines 40-47):

```
5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard
├── [-] reviews.self[slug=all-done-self]
├── [-] reviews.self[slug=all-done-junior]
├── [+] reviews.self[slug=behavior.declaration.coverage]
├── [+] reviews.self[slug=behavior.declaration.adherance]
├── [+] reviews.self[slug=role.standards.adherance]
└── [+] reviews.self[slug=role.standards.coverage]
```

### actual implementation (src/.../5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.guard):

```yaml
reviews:
  self:
    - slug: behavior.declaration.coverage
    - slug: behavior.declaration.adherance
    - slug: role.standards.adherance
    - slug: role.standards.coverage
```

| removed | verified absent? |

| all-done-junior | ✓ yes, grep confirms absent |

| added | verified present? |
|-------|-------------------|
| behavior.declaration.coverage | ✓ yes, line 7 |
| behavior.declaration.adherance | ✓ yes, line 26 |
| role.standards.adherance | ✓ yes, line 45 |
| role.standards.coverage | ✓ yes, line 61 |

## say block content verification

the blueprint specifies say blocks with:
- junior detection language
- checklist items
- report path pattern
- fix instruction

### execution guard say blocks:

| review | junior detection? | checklist? | report path? | fix instruction? |
|--------|-------------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| behavior.declaration.coverage | ✓ line 11 | ✓ lines 16-20 | ✓ line 22 | ✓ line 23 |
| behavior.declaration.adherance | ✓ line 30 | ✓ lines 35-39 | ✓ line 41 | ✓ line 42 |
| role.standards.adherance | ✓ line 49 | ✓ lines 53-56 | ✓ line 58 | ✓ line 59 |
| role.standards.coverage | ✓ line 66 | ✓ lines 70-73 | ✓ line 75 | ✓ line 76 |

### blueprint guard say blocks:

| review | junior detection? | checklist? | report path? | fix instruction? |
|--------|-------------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| behavior.declaration.coverage | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| behavior.declaration.adherance | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| role.standards.adherance | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| role.standards.coverage | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## blueprint vs execution guard difference

the blueprint specifies that:
- execution guard references "vision, criteria, AND blueprint"
- blueprint guard references "vision and criteria" only

### verification:

execution guard line 15-16:
```
go through the behavior's vision, criteria, and blueprint, then check
```

blueprint guard line 11-12:
```
go through the behavior's vision and criteria, then check
```

✓ correct - execution includes blueprint, blueprint does not

---

## test file verification

blueprint says: "the test may need snapshot updates"

### verification:

| change | done? |
|--------|-------|
| promise commands use new slugs | ✓ behavior.declaration.coverage, etc. |
| assertions check new slug | ✓ changed from all-done-self |
| snapshots updated | ✓ via RESNAP=true |

---

## gaps detected

none. every line of the blueprint is satisfied by the implementation.

---

## conclusion

i reviewed each line of the blueprint against the implementation. the junior did not introduce any gaps, mistakes, or deviations. the work is complete and correct.

# self-review: behavior.declaration.coverage

## question

review for coverage of the behavior declaration.

go through the behavior's vision, criteria, and blueprint, then check each requirement against the code line by line.

## review

i paused. took a breath. examined the implementation with stillness.

### vision requirements check

| requirement | covered? | evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| standardized 2x2 frame | ✓ | both guards have 4 reviews in correct order |
| priority order (1-4) | ✓ | declaration.coverage → declaration.adherance → standards.adherance → standards.coverage |
| detailed say blocks | ✓ | each review has multi-line say with checklist items |
| junior detection language | ✓ | "our systems have detected that a junior touched this pr" in all say blocks |
| report path pattern | ✓ | `.behavior/$thisBehavior/reviews/{stone}.{slug}.md` in all say blocks |
| fix instruction | ✓ | "then fix all gaps before you continue" in all say blocks |

### blueprint requirements check

| requirement | covered? | evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| execution guard: 4 reviews | ✓ | file has exactly 4 reviews |
| execution guard: no judges | ✓ | no judges section present |
| execution guard: refs blueprint | ✓ | say blocks reference "vision, criteria, and blueprint" |
| blueprint guard: 4 reviews | ✓ | file has exactly 4 reviews |
| blueprint guard: has judges | ✓ | judges section retained |
| blueprint guard: refs vision+criteria only | ✓ | say blocks reference "vision and criteria" (not blueprint) |

### criteria requirements check

| requirement | covered? | evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| template changes only | ✓ | only guard templates modified |
| retain criteria guard | ✓ | 2.1.criteria.blackbox.guard unchanged |
| retain vision guard | ✓ | 1.vision.guard unchanged |

## gaps found

none. all requirements from vision, criteria, and blueprint are covered.

---

## conclusion

the implementation covers all requirements from the behavior declaration. no omissions detected.

wish =

would be great to have a bhuild decomposer role 🍄

which would

1. skill <review> = inform via reviews when to decompose a behavior
   1. e.g., "hazard: this is too large for a brain to keep in context at one time. decompose to maximize success"

2. skill <decompose> = decompose a behavior into sub-behaviors
   1. --mode plan
    2. e.g., propose the sub-behaviors to decompose into in order to madximize parallelism and minimize dependents (maximize throughput)
    3. e.g., identify maximally isolated contracts to maximize composability and independence + reuse (maximize leverage)

   2. --mode apply
      1. actually `init.behavior` on each --plan'ed subbehavior decomposition
      2. decompose the wish, vision, criteria from the source behavior into the child behaviors, per subbehavior
         1. wish is always declared, so always decomposed
         2. vision is decomposed only if original vision was declared
         4. never decompose criteria, research, blueprint, or etc though - always demand that be re-generated from scratch given the udpated decomposition
      3. and leave a reference doc of of "z.decomposed.md" in the parent behavior
         1. tells future travelers what happended to this behavior

   - that way, the user can easily get started with their decomposed behaviors - doing each behavior independnelty

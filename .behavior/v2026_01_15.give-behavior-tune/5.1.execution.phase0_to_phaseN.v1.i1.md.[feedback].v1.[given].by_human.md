# blocker.1

before we clear the terminl, we should emit as many new lines as we'll emit on startup, so that we overwrite only our own terminal newlines (and dont hide their prior messages)

also, we should emit a unicode line that takes up the width of their terminal at the start of our repl

that way its clear where ours started


# blocker.2

remove the header box. its not visible right now anyway and its good as is, so remove the deadcode


# blocker.3

within this output

  🎤 feedback repl

     enter feedback for the artifact under review.
     each entry is saved to the feedback file in realtime.

     controls:
     ├─ enter        submit feedback
     ├─ shift+enter  newline
     ├─ shift+tab    toggle blocker/nitpick
     ├─ ctrl+z       undo
     ├─ ctrl+y       redo
     ├─ ↑/↓          navigate history
     └─ ctrl+c       clear input (or exit if empty)

     3 prior feedback item(s) found

  it should specify

     3 prior feedback item(s) found
     ├─ $relpath
     ├─ 3 blockers
     └─ 1 nitpick


and after the blockers and nitpick words, it should render a unicode circle of red & yellow (red for blocker, yellow for nitpick) (both dimmed)

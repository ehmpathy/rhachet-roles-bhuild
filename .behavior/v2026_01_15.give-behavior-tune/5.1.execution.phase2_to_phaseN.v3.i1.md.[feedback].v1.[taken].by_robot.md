# response checklist

## blocker.1 - terminal newlines + separator line

- [x] count how many lines the welcome header emits (14 base + 5 if prior feedback)
- [x] emit that many newlines BEFORE console.clear()
- [x] add horizontal unicode separator line at start of repl output

## blocker.2 - remove dead header box

- [x] remove the bordered header box from FeedbackRepl.tsx
- [x] keep only the severity/index line and input area
- [x] remove unused blockerCount/nitpickCount state variables
- [x] update tests to reflect header removal

## blocker.3 - prior feedback details display

- [x] already implemented in runFeedbackRepl.ts lines 40-58
- [x] format matches expectation (relpath, blockers count, nitpicks count with colored circles)

## blocker.4 - cursor not visible

- [x] investigate why cursor is not visible in --talk mode
- [x] check if ink rendering is working correctly
- [x] verify cursorVisible state and inverse text rendering

**finding**: the cursor IS being rendered correctly with ANSI inverse codes.
snapshot shows: `> [7m [27m` where `[7m` = inverse on, space = cursor char, `[27m` = inverse off

the cursor implementation is verified correct via tests. if cursor is not visible in actual terminal:
- terminal may not support ANSI inverse video
- terminal theme may have same fg/bg for inverted text
- or console.log() output before ink render may interfere

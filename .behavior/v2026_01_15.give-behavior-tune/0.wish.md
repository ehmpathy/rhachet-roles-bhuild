1. tune the appexp of this output

    rhachet.vlad.hook-adapter on vlad/hook-adapter [$✘»+] is 1.22.0 at 12:49:57
    ➜ npx rhachet run --skill give.feedback --against execution

    🪨  run solid skill repo=bhuild/role=behaver/skill=give.feedback

specifically, in the part we control for the give.feedback skill

these should be relative paths

and we should say something like


🦫 wassup?
   ├─ .behavior/v2026_01_09.hook-adapter/5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.i1.md.[feedback].v1.[given].by_human.md
   └─ opened in codium


where just like the init.behavior, it says "open in codium" if --open codium run (just like init.behavior) or displays the tip to remind them they can open otherwise


----


2. we want a repl interactive mode, where

--talk invokes the repl mode

and

it has the features of

- defaults severity to "blocker", listens to "shift+tab" to switch between "blocker" and "nitpick"
- asks for the user's feedback ; allows them to write multiline
- when they hit enter, it submits it
- when they hit ctrl-c, it clears it (but says they can undo with ctrl-z after they ctrl-z, if the last action was cancel)
- when its clear, on pressing up, allows them to go back to previous feedback to edit it


the goal is to make it easy to add feedback in the terminal

e.g.,


`npx rhachet run --skill give.feedback --talk --against execution`

it should also be super super clear which Number of Blocker/Nitpick you're on (i.e., # blocker.N / # nitpick.N should be the footer)

it should also mutate the feedback file as the feedback is given.

i.e.,
- upsert a given # {blocker|nitpick}.{index} block
- enable undos, (maybe, track an .log dir in that behavior dir, to which we emit a jsonl of change events { index, severity, before, after })

and also

1. the multiline input must be supported inline, just like claude-code

2. we want to support shift+enter to newline (instead of submit), as well as alt+enter

3. the header should be below the users input box, just like on claude code (really, its a footer then)



---

1. we also want to ensure that someone can call `give.feedback` on a version that already exists, and it'll idempotenly
  - findsert (find it exists)
  - stdout (i.e, say 'already exists')
  - and react
    - --open if specified to --open
    - --talk if specified to talk

when it does already exist though, it should also stdout that tip that says how to create a new --version still

it should just also findsert

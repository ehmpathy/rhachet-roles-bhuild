# blocker.1

add rule briefs for blackbox and blueprint criterias too now;
also, lets update the briefs and the skill to make it clear that
 blueprint criteria should ONLY be at the contract layer; it
should never prescribe internals, but only declare required
boundaries and composition contracts ; e.g., "we want these
subcomponents exposed for use to fulfill the blackbox, with
these contracts, but _how_ they're built will be researched and
decided when the blueprint is ultimately written"

# blocker.2

per src/domain.roles/behaver/briefs/practices/behavior.criteria/define.criteria-blackbox-vs-blueprint.md

> separating blackbox from blueprint criteria prevents conflation of "what we're building" with "what contracts we need". this separation ensures:

blackbox = why we're building

if its not needed for blackbox, its not needed at all;

blueprint = what we're building

its the core contracts that were prescribed, if any. blueprints are not always prescribed with bounded criteria, but when they are, its only at the contract level - and only to narrow down what will be built upfront to fulfill the blackbox

but blackbox = the why. its the declaration of why its needed via usage examples and experience constraints.

the what is built is _demonstrated_ in the blackbox, but only constrained & bound in the blueprint criteria formally.

does that make sense? or is that not quite rigth?

or is it more like
- blackbox = experience bounds; constraints and requirements we must fulfill
- blueprint = mechanism bounds; constraints and requirements we must fulfill

# blocker.3

the examples in criteria-blackbox and criteria-blueprint dont do a good job of demonstrating strong criteria exampmles

no given/when/then decompositions with different events

no when([t0] before any changes) + when([t1] $event occured)

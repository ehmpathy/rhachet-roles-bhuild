wish =

we want to update the `init.behavior` skill to separate `2.criteria.blackbox.md` vs `2.critiera.blueprint.md`

why? we've found recently that when they're joined, on bigger tasks, its too easy to jump down to blueprint level criteria (e.g., the different contracts and flows we want to build with; the technical criteria) whereas its very critical that the blackbox behavioral criteria is super clear; the blackbox behavioral criteria is the only reason the bluprint critiera would even be worth to build. its also the purest declaration of how we will fulfill and distill the actual usecases that users have.

we should first add behaver/briefs on these two topics indepednently and in comparison (3 briefs) to clearly articulate what they are and why they matter.

then, update the init.behavior generated files to walk through builders to do both separately

ref prompt that worked in the past to splitout critiera.blackbox from criteria.blueprint

> lets create a 2.criteria.blackbox.md doc now where we
zoomout and blackbox the experience from the users
perspective; what inputs and outputs will they interface
with; what usecases will they solve with these skills; when
will they use what; and how will they fulfill the core
desires from the wish in
.behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/0.wish.md ?

---

why?

2.criteria.md seems too prescriptive of internals now

seems like its blueprint criteria vs behavior criteria actually

blackbox criteria being behavior criteria for acceptance testing the produced behavior

---

note: longterm, we should better standardize on the differences, because there's def blueprint level criteria we also want to be able to review

but it is much less important than the blackbox criteria

e.g.,

- blackbox criteria = behavioral experience (experience chioces)
- blueprint criteria = behavioral implementation (arch choices, mech choices)

more context, from convos about the terms


  The relationship:

  blackbox ⊂ blueprint

  - blackbox = pure behavioral requirements (what users experience)
  - blueprint = the complete plan that satisfies blackbox + adds architectural constraints

  This maps cleanly to construction:
  - requirements = "building must have 3 bedrooms, natural light, wheelchair access"
  - blueprint = the architectural plan that fulfills those requirements + specifies how (load-bearing walls here, plumbing there, etc.)

  The blueprint doesn't contradict the requirements — it incorporates and extends them. Fulfilling the blueprint means the blackbox is satisfied by definition.

  So the terms work:

  | term               | scope                 | relationship                               |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
  | criteria.blackbox  | what users experience | foundational, must be satisfied            |
  | criteria.blueprint | how we build it       | superset, includes blackbox + arch choices |

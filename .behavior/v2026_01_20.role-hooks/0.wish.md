wish =

like was done in https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-ehmpathy/pull/167

we want to drop the adhoc hooks management from this repo

and instead leverage rhachet's new Role.hooks.onBrain interface

upgrade to it and remove all the current hook management logic

use gh api to lookup how that pr did it

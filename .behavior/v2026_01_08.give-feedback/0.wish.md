we had a simple skill, similar to init.behavior, called `give.feedback`,

which would instantiate that .ref.[feedback].v1.[given].by_human.md file against whatever the --against target was

e.g.,


`npx rhachet run --skill give.feedback --against execution`, would generate

$BEHAVIOR_DIR/${latestExecutionFileName}.[feedback].v1.[given].by_human.md

where latestExecutionFile is computed based on

*.execution.*.v*.i*.md && does not have [feedback] in it

e.g.,

$BEHAVIOR_DIR/5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1.i1.md.[feedback].v1.[given].by_human.md

---

and inside of it, also replace .ref with ${latestExecutionFileName} too


---

where the feedback file is instantiated based on a --template

which defaults to `.ref.[feedback].v1.[given].by_human.md` within the behavior dir


---

also, the command should take in a `--behavior` flag

its optional if the current branch is bound already, via the `bind.behavior get` lookup

if not already bound though, it shoudl be required and failfast if not given

that way we can know which directory to give.feedback in (and lookup the --against target)

---

should be able to generate feedback for any behavior asset, not just execution.
  (e.g., blueprint, criteria, etc)

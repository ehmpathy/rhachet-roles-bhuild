wish =

we've been banned from the use of this demo github token pat, due to being flagged as a bot

instead, we should use the github app we setup earlier instead

how can we use that github app to 

1. create the token for local integration & acceptance tests

2. create the token for cloud integration & acceptance tests (via ghactions)


?

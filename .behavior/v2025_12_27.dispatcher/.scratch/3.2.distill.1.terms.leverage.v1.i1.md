## 1. fundamental atomic concepts


### 1.1. concept: the ratio pattern

**what it is:**
leverage is fundamentally a **ratio** — comparing what you get to what you put in, or comparing output to baseline.

**manifestations in research:**

| source | numerator | denominator | ratio name |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| ICSE 2021 | dependencies_code | own_code | technical_leverage |
| ROI formula | gains - costs | costs | roi_leverage |
| force multiplier | output_with_tool | output_without_tool | velocity_leverage |
| platform eng | developers_supported | platform_team_size | platform_leverage |
| time leverage | time_saved | time_invested | time_leverage |

**atomic insight:**
> leverage is always `amplified_output / baseline_output` or `benefit / investment`


### 1.2. concept: direct vs transitive

**what it is:**
impact can be **direct** (immediate, first-order) or **transitive** (downstream, cascading, nth-order).

**manifestations in research:**

| source | direct term | transitive term |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| wish | "direct impact" | "dependent impact" |
| ICSE 2021 | own_code | dependencies (level-1, level-n) |
| dep analysis | direct dependencies | transitive dependencies |
| platform eng | individual productivity | team/org productivity |

**atomic insight:**
> leverage compounds transitively — unblocking one thing may unblock many downstream things


### 1.3. concept: maintenance vs velocity

**what it is:**
leverage manifests in two temporal modes: **ongoing cost reduction** and **future throughput acceleration**.

**manifestations in research:**

| source | maintenance-like | velocity-like |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| DORA | stability (CFR, MTTR) | throughput (DF, LT) |
| SPACE | satisfaction, well-being | efficiency, flow |
| DX core 4 | quality | speed, effectiveness |
| mckinsey | outer loop reduction | inner loop maximization |
| platform | operational overhead | delivery speed |

**atomic insight:**
> leverage can save time repeatedly (maintenance) or accelerate future work (velocity)


### 1.4. concept: the multiplication effect

**what it is:**
a **force multiplier** makes the same input produce disproportionately more output.

**manifestations in research:**

| source | term used | meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| mayer | force multiplier | tools/practices that amplify productivity |
| ardalis | team force multiplier | person who improves team's output beyond own work |
| platform eng | multiplier effect | small team enables thousands |
| automation | multiplication factor | reproducible process scaled in parallel |

**atomic insight:**
> leverage = how much MORE you get than you would have without the leverage

## 3. candidate terms for ubiquitous language


### 3.1. the core term: leverage

**options considered:**

| term | pros | cons |
|------|------|------|
| **leverage** | finance origin, ratio-native, widely understood, research-standard | sometimes confused with "using" |
| multiplier | explicit ratio meaning | less common in domain |
| amplification | signal processing origin, clear | less intuitive |
| uplift | finance term | less common |
| boost | simple | too informal |

**recommendation:** `leverage`

> leverage is the established term in both academic research (ICSE 2021) and industry (mckinsey DVI, platform engineering). it carries the ratio semantics from finance and is intuitive.


### 3.2. dimension 1: maintenance

**what it captures:**
ongoing cost reduction — fewer incidents, easier onboarding, better docs, reduced operational overhead.

**options considered:**

| term | pros | cons |
|------|------|------|
| **maintenance** | DORA stability maps here, intuitive | sometimes means "upkeep work" |
| sustainment | less overloaded | less common |
| operational | platform eng uses this | too broad |
| upkeep | simple | too informal |
| stability | DORA term | conflicts with DORA's specific meaning |

**recommendation:** `maintenance`

> maintenance leverage = how much ongoing cost this behavior reduces over time.


### 3.3. dimension 2: velocity

**what it captures:**
future throughput acceleration — unblocking dependencies, enabling parallelism, accelerating future delivery.

**options considered:**

| term | pros | cons |
|------|------|------|
| **velocity** | mckinsey/DORA term, intuitive, speed connotation | sometimes confused with story points |
| throughput | DORA term, precise | less intuitive |
| acceleration | captures "faster over time" | more about change rate |
| enablement | captures unblocking | too vague |
| unblockage | very specific to deps | too narrow |

**recommendation:** `velocity`

> velocity leverage = how much this behavior accelerates future development throughput.


### 3.4. sub-dimension candidates

within each dimension, what atomic factors contribute?

**maintenance factors:**

| factor | what it measures | term options |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| fewer incidents | reduction in failures | `incidentReduction`, `failureReduction` |
| faster recovery | MTTR improvement | `recoverySpeed`, `mttrImprovement` |
| easier onboarding | time for new person to ramp | `onboardingEase`, `rampSpeed` |
| documentation quality | knowledge codification | `documentationQuality`, `knowledgeCapture` |

**velocity factors:**

| factor | what it measures | term options |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| unblocking direct | behaviors this directly unblocks | `unblockDirect`, `dependentsUnblockedDirect` |
| unblocking transitive | behaviors transitively unblocked | `unblockTransitive`, `dependentsUnblockedTransitive` |
| reusability | potential for reuse | `reusability`, `reuseability` |
| parallelization | enables concurrent work | `parallelizationEnabled`, `concurrencyGain` |

## 4. symmetry analysis


### 4.1. current model structure

from the wish and prior distillation:

```
gain
├── yieldage         # direct value produced
│   ├── direct       # first-order impact
│   └── transitive   # cascading impact
└── leverage         # multiplicative effect
    ├── ???          # dimension 1
    └── ???          # dimension 2
```


### 4.2. symmetry with yieldage

yieldage has `direct` and `transitive` sub-dimensions.

should leverage have the same?

| approach | structure | pros | cons |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| **A: parallel to yieldage** | leverage.direct, leverage.transitive | symmetric | doesn't capture maintenance/velocity distinction |
| **B: orthogonal to yieldage** | leverage.maintenance, leverage.velocity | captures the two modes | not symmetric with yieldage |
| **C: nested hybrid** | leverage.maintenance{direct,trans}, leverage.velocity{direct,trans} | captures both | overly complex |

**analysis:**

the direct/transitive distinction applies to BOTH yieldage and leverage:
- yieldage.direct = value this behavior produces directly
- yieldage.transitive = value produced by behaviors this enables
- leverage.maintenance.direct = maintenance cost this behavior directly reduces
- leverage.maintenance.transitive = maintenance cost transitively reduced
- leverage.velocity.direct = behaviors this directly unblocks
- leverage.velocity.transitive = behaviors transitively unblocked

**however**, for simplicity, the transitive dimension may be better captured at the composite level rather than per-dimension.


### 4.3. recommended structure

```
gain
├── yieldage
│   ├── distribution[]    # probabilistic outcomes
│   └── expected          # weighted average
└── leverage
    ├── maintenance       # ongoing cost reduction factor
    ├── velocity          # throughput acceleration factor
    └── composite         # weighted combination
```

where:
- `maintenance` = scalar [0, ∞) measuring ongoing cost reduction
- `velocity` = scalar [0, ∞) measuring throughput acceleration
- `composite` = weighted combination for comparison

## 5. proposed ubiquitous language


### 5.1. core insight: leverage = input efficiency

leverage measures **how much LESS input is required to produce the SAME output**.

this is the fundamental ratio:
```
leverage = effort_before / effort_after
```

where:
- `effort_before` = input required WITHOUT the behavior
- `effort_after` = input required WITH the behavior

this applies uniformly across dimensions:
- maintenance leverage: less effort to maintain the same system
- velocity leverage: less effort to produce the same output


### 5.2. term definitions

| term | definition | formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| **leverage** | how much less input is required for equivalent output | `effort_before / effort_after` |
| **leverage.maintenance** | how much less effort to maintain the system | `maintain_effort_before / maintain_effort_after` |
| **leverage.velocity** | how much less effort to produce/deliver | `produce_effort_before / produce_effort_after` |
| **leverage.composite** | weighted combination of maintenance and velocity | weighted average |


### 5.3. intuitive interpretations

| value | meaning | example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1.0 | no change | same effort required as before |
| 2.0 | 2x leverage | half the effort required (50% reduction) |
| 5.0 | 5x leverage | 1/5th the effort required (80% reduction) |
| 10.0 | 10x leverage | 1/10th the effort required (90% reduction) |

**note:** leverage < 1.0 means the behavior INCREASES effort (negative leverage / friction).


### 5.4. dimension-specific examples

**maintenance leverage:**
```
before: 10 hours/week to handle incidents and support
after:  2 hours/week (due to better monitoring, docs, stability)
leverage.maintenance = 10 / 2 = 5.0
→ "this behavior provides 5x maintenance leverage"
```

**velocity leverage:**
```
before: 40 hours to ship a feature (blocked by manual setup)
after:  10 hours to ship (due to automation, unblocking)
leverage.velocity = 40 / 10 = 4.0
→ "this behavior provides 4x velocity leverage"
```


### 5.5. usage examples

```
"behavior X has 4x velocity leverage — it quarters the effort to ship dependent features"

"behavior Y has 5x maintenance leverage — ongoing support drops from 10 to 2 hours/week"

"behavior Z has leverage.composite of 3.2 — on average, 3x less effort across dimensions"
```

## 7. summary


### 7.1. core formula

```
leverage = effort_before / effort_after
```

leverage measures **input efficiency** — how much LESS effort is required for EQUIVALENT output.


### 7.2. recommended terms

| concept | term | definition |
|---------|------|------------|
| input efficiency | `leverage` | effort_before / effort_after |
| maintenance efficiency | `leverage.maintenance` | how much less effort to maintain |
| delivery efficiency | `leverage.velocity` | how much less effort to produce |
| combined efficiency | `leverage.composite` | weighted average of dimensions |


### 7.3. key principles applied

1. **ubiquity**: terms align with established research (ICSE, DORA, mckinsey)
2. **intuition**: terms have clear everyday meanings (less effort = more leverage)
3. **symmetry**: both dimensions use identical ratio formula
4. **expressiveness**: terms enable precise discussion of leverage types
5. **ratio-native**: leverage is always `before / after`, producing dimensionless multiplier


### 7.4. open questions

1. should `maintenance` and `velocity` be further decomposed into factors?
2. how should direct vs transitive be incorporated — per-dimension or at composite level?
3. what are the appropriate default weights for composite computation?
4. how to estimate effort_before when the "before" state is hypothetical?

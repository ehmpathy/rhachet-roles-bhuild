## 1. tool description

declapract-typescript-ehmpathy is a package of 40+ battle-tested TypeScript best practices:
- typescript config, eslint, prettier
- jest, conventional commits, husky hooks
- github actions workflows (test, publish, deploy)
- aws lambda patterns (handlers, logging, config)
- terraform infrastructure patterns
- postgresql and dynamodb access patterns
- react native / expo configuration

## 2. leverage narrative

### 2.1. what problem does it solve?

setting up typescript projects by hand is:
- **slow**: hours to configure tooling per project
- **inconsistent**: different configs across projects
- **undocumented**: why was this linting rule chosen?
- **drift-prone**: practices evolve but old projects don't

### 2.2. how does it create leverage?

the declarations package **codifies years of production experience** into instant inheritance:

```
wout declapract-typescript-ehmpathy:
  per project: 4-8 hours to configure tooling
  practice knowledge: tribal, undocumented
  updates: manual per repo

with declapract-typescript-ehmpathy:
  per project: 5 minutes (declapract apply)
  practice knowledge: documented in declarations
  updates: bump version, apply
```

**leverage ratio:** ~50-100x for project setup

### 2.3. where does leverage compound?

1. **adoptable → authorable**: every project starts with production-ready config
2. **documented → supportable**: practices include rationale for debugging context
3. **evolvable → maintainable**: upgrade declarations, apply across all repos

## 3. leverage measurements

### 3.1. leverage.authorable

| subdimension | score | rationale |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **simpler** | 10/10 | inherit 40+ practices with one config file |
| **faster** | 10/10 | minutes vs hours for project setup |
| **safer** | 9/10 | battle-tested patterns prevent common mistakes |

**composite:** 9.7/10

**narrative:** "new projects inherit production-ready typescript configuration in minutes. 40+ practices covering tooling, testing, CI/CD, and infrastructure."


### 3.2. leverage.supportable

| subdimension | score | rationale |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **observable** | 8/10 | consistent logging, structured errors across projects |
| **intuitive** | 8/10 | same patterns everywhere; debug one, debug all |
| **resilient** | 8/10 | battle-tested patterns handle edge cases |
| **maintainable** | 9/10 | update declarations, propagate everywhere |

**composite:** 8.3/10

**narrative:** "all projects look the same. debugging skills transfer. practice updates propagate instantly."


### 3.3. leverage.adoptable

| subdimension | score | rationale |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **reusable** | 10/10 | any typescript project can use these declarations |
| **pitofsuccess** | 9/10 | CI enforces practices; hard to ship violations |
| **documented** | 9/10 | practices include rationale and examples |
| **evolvable** | 10/10 | version bumps bring new practices |

**composite:** 9.5/10

**narrative:** "any typescript project adopts with one config file. version bumps bring years of accumulated improvements."

## 4. gain analysis

### 4.1. absolute gain per use

| metric | wout declarations | with declarations | gain |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| project setup time | 4-8 hours | 5 minutes | 50-100x |
| tooling consistency | variable | 100% | ∞ |
| practice documentation | none | included | ∞ |
| upgrade propagation | N repos × hours | 1 command | N×100x |

**absolute gain per use:** ~75x for project setup


### 4.2. relative frequency (how often we gain)

| scenario | frequency | notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| new project setup | high | every new service/library |
| practice compliance | very high (every PR) | CI integration |
| tooling upgrades | medium (quarterly) | version bumps |
| debugging unfamiliar project | high | consistent patterns |

**coverage:** every typescript project benefits


### 4.3. compound leverage

```
total_leverage = absolute_gain × frequency × compound_factor × repo_multiplier

where:
  absolute_gain = 75x (project setup)
  frequency = 0.9 (90% of ts projects need these practices)
  compound_factor = 1.6 (supportable + adoptable benefits)
  repo_multiplier = N (number of repos)

for 10 repos:
total_leverage = 75 × 0.9 × 1.6 × 10 = 1080x effective leverage
```

## 5. dimension summary

| dimension | score | key insight |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| leverage.authorable | 9.7/10 | minutes to production-ready config |
| leverage.supportable | 8.3/10 | consistent patterns; transferable skills |
| leverage.adoptable | 9.5/10 | any ts project; version bumps = free upgrades |

**overall leverage grade:** A (9.2/10)

**one-sentence summary:** declapract-typescript-ehmpathy provides ~1080x effective leverage (for 10 repos) by packaging years of typescript best practices into an instantly inheritable configuration.

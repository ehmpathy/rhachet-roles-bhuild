specifically, narrow your focus down to

  specify how leverage is measured in industry

  specifically research how leverage is defined and measured by researchers, builders, and industry

now, specifically narrow down to broaden what was given as an initial seed from the human here
- .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain.leverage.v0.seed.md

expand on it. further, find contradictions or supports from the research done in the v1 and v2 research docs here
- .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain.leverage.v1.i1.md
- .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain.leverage.v2.i1.md

our goal is that
1. we can articulate the human's thoughts more thoroughly, to expand their unique perspective
2. we can compare this articulation to identify how it aligns or disagrees with concepts found from research across the other domains

---

specifically
- what are the domain objects that are involved with this wish
  - entities
  - events
  - literals
- what are the domain operations
  - getOne
  - getAll
  - setCreate
  - setUpdate
  - setDelete
- what are the relationships between the domain objects?
  - is there a treestruct of decoration?
  - is there a treestruct of common subdomains?
  - are there dependencies?
- how do the domain objects and operations compose to support wish?

---

use web search to discover and research
- cite every claim
- number each citation
- clone exact quotes from each citation

---

cite atleast 11 sources

---

emit into .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain.leverage.v3.i1.md

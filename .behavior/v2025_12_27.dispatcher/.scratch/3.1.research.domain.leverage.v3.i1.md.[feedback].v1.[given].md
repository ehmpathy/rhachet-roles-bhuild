# blocker.1

in the universal patterns, can we make clear the lever arms
 "length" role in leverage ?




# blocker.2

> for dimensino analysis of composability, we must be able to
 measure the composability of a tool; how easy it is to
compose is a key leverage trait (not just its overall
leverage_total when composed)

e.g., if we want to prioritize some work to increase the
composability of a tool, we must be able to measure the gain
in leverage from that


# blocker.3

> how could we narrow down and make the terms more intuitive
and less highbrow; e.g., leverage_via_faster,
leverage_via_simpler, leverage_via_safer,
leverage_via_observable, leverage_via_readable, etc? any
better options?

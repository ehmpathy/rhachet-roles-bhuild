lets extend .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain.leverage.v1.i1.md

---

specifically, narrow your focus down to


  specify how leverage is measured in industry

  declare atleast 11 citations

  specifically research how leverage is defined and measured by researchers, builders, and industry

narrowed further down, in this extension

  to how physics, mechanics, ecology, biology, and other non-software industries speak about leverage and measure leverage


---

our goal is that by going deeper than just software we can generalize more accurately about what leverage is

as the terms and frames currently found in software domains seem artificial and unuseful; they seem detached from reality. (e.g., loc? are ya kidding? lines of code? heard of a minifier? what about comments? total bs)

---

specifically
- what are the domain objects that are involved with this wish
  - entities
  - events
  - literals
- what are the domain operations
  - getOne
  - getAll
  - setCreate
  - setUpdate
  - setDelete
- what are the relationships between the domain objects?
  - is there a treestruct of decoration?
  - is there a treestruct of common subdomains?
  - are there dependencies?
- how do the domain objects and operations compose to support wish?

---

use web search to discover and research
- cite every claim
- number each citation
- clone exact quotes from each citation

---

cite atleast 21 sources

---

emit into .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain.leverage.v2.i1.md

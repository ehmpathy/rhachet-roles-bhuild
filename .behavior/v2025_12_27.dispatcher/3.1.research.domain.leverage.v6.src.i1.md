## 2. dimension scores summary

### 2.1. scores by tool

| tool | authorable | supportable | adoptable | overall |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| dynamodb-dao-generator | 9.3 | 8.5 | 8.3 | 8.7 (A) |
| with-simple-cache | 9.3 | 7.8 | 8.5 | 8.5 (B+) |
| simple-in-memory-cache | 9.3 | 7.5 | 8.3 | 8.4 (B+) |
| type-fns | 8.7 | 9.7 | 9.0 | 9.1 (A-) |
| declapract | 8.7 | 7.8 | 9.3 | 8.6 (A) |
| declapract-typescript-ehmpathy | 9.7 | 8.3 | 9.5 | 9.2 (A) |
| declastruct-aws | 9.0 | 8.5 | 8.3 | 8.6 (A-) |

**average:** authorable=9.1, supportable=8.3, adoptable=8.7


### 2.2. effective leverage by tool

| tool | absolute gain | frequency | compound | effective leverage |
|------|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| dynamodb-dao-generator | 50x | 40% | 1.5 | **30x** |
| with-simple-cache | 25x | 15% | 1.3 | **5x** |
| simple-in-memory-cache | 40x | 60% | 1.4 | **34x** |
| type-fns | 10x | 30% | 1.2 | **4x** |
| declapract | 100x | 80% | 1.5×N | **1200x** (10 repos) |
| declapract-typescript-ehmpathy | 75x | 90% | 1.6×N | **1080x** (10 repos) |
| declastruct-aws | 30x | 70% | 2.0 | **42x** |

## 3. leverage patterns observed

### 3.1. leverage amplification patterns

| pattern | tools exhibiting | mechanism |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **codegen** | dynamodb-dao-generator | transform arm.effort into generated code |
| **wrapper** | with-simple-cache | wrap existing functions with new behavior |
| **primitive** | simple-in-memory-cache, type-fns | provide building blocks for composition |
| **declarations** | declapract, declapract-ts-ehmpathy | codify knowledge into inheritable config |
| **declarative** | declastruct-aws | replace imperative with declarative |


### 3.2. frequency vs absolute gain tradeoff

```
high frequency + low gain = type-fns (4x effective, but used constantly)
low frequency + high gain = dynamodb-dao-generator (30x, but only for DAOs)
high frequency + high gain = declapract-ts-ehmpathy (1080x, everywhere)
```

**insight:** the highest leverage tools combine high frequency with high gain via the **repo multiplier** (declarations that apply across N repos).


### 3.3. dimension correlation patterns

| pattern | observation |
|---------|-------------|
| authorable→adoptable | easy to write → easy to adopt (strong correlation) |
| adoptable→supportable | easy to adopt → consistent patterns → easier support (moderate) |
| supportable→authorable | easier support → faster iteration (weak, indirect) |

## 4. lifecycle validation

### 4.1. leverage.authorable subdimensions validated

| subdimension | tools that excel | tools that lag |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **simpler** | declapract-ts-ehmpathy (10/10) | none below 8 |
| **faster** | declapract-ts-ehmpathy (10/10) | type-fns (8/10, micro-gains) |
| **safer** | declastruct-aws (10/10, plan phase) | none below 8 |

**insight:** authorable subdimensions are highly correlated. tools that excel in one tend to excel in all.


### 4.2. leverage.supportable subdimensions validated

| subdimension | tools that excel | tools that lag |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **observable** | declastruct-aws (9/10, git history) | simple-in-memory-cache (5/10) |
| **intuitive** | type-fns (10/10, self-documenting) | declapract (7/10, learning curve) |
| **resilient** | declastruct-aws (9/10, rollback) | simple-in-memory-cache (6/10) |
| **maintainable** | type-fns (10/10) | with-simple-cache (9/10) |

**insight:** supportable subdimensions vary independently. a tool can be intuitive but not observable.


### 4.3. leverage.adoptable subdimensions validated

| subdimension | tools that excel | tools that lag |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **reusable** | with-simple-cache (10/10, any fn) | declastruct-aws (8/10, AWS-specific) |
| **pitofsuccess** | dynamodb-dao-generator (9/10) | none below 8 |
| **documented** | declapract-ts-ehmpathy (9/10) | declastruct-aws (7/10) |
| **evolvable** | declapract-ts-ehmpathy (10/10) | simple-in-memory-cache (7/10) |

**insight:** adoptable depends heavily on scope. narrower scope (AWS) can still be highly adoptable within that scope.

## 5. refined leverage model

### 5.1. lifecycle-based framework validated

the three lifecycle phases work well:

```
leverage.authorable (author time)
├── ease of writing new code with this tool
├── subdimensions: simpler, faster, safer
└── measured by: time to produce, cognitive load, defect rate

leverage.supportable (upkeep time)
├── ease of maintaining systems built with this tool
├── subdimensions: observable, intuitive, resilient, maintainable
└── measured by: MTTR, debug time, incident frequency

leverage.adoptable (adoption time)
├── ease of adopting the tool itself
├── subdimensions: reusable, pitofsuccess, documented, evolvable
└── measured by: adoption cost, range of usecases, upgrade path
```


### 5.2. adoption cost breakdown validated

adoption has two cost components:

1. **architect cost** = time to learn that a tool exists, can be adopted, and how
   - measured by: documentation quality, discoverability
   - e.g., declapract-ts-ehmpathy: low architect cost (well documented)

2. **integration cost** = time to integrate the tool into existing codebase
   - measured by: breaking changes, migration effort
   - e.g., type-fns: very low integration cost (pure functions)


### 5.3. leverage composition validated

tools compose to multiply leverage:

```
simple-in-memory-cache (34x) + with-simple-cache (5x)
= complete memoization solution
= 34x + 5x + composition_bonus ≈ 50x effective leverage

declapract (1200x) + declapract-ts-ehmpathy (1080x)
= complete practice management
= platform leverage (not additive, but enabling)
```

## 6. open questions from evaluation

### 6.1. measurement precision

- how to accurately measure "absolute gain per use"?
- should we use time (hours saved) or complexity (lines avoided)?
- how to account for learning curve in adoption cost?

### 6.2. frequency estimation

- how to estimate "frequency of applicable scenarios"?
- should frequency be measured per-project or per-developer?
- how to handle tools with irregular usage patterns?

### 6.3. compound factor

- what formula best captures compound benefits?
- how to weight repo multiplier for declaration-based tools?
- is multiplication the right model, or should it be exponential?

## 7. conclusions

### 7.1. leverage dimension framework works

the three lifecycle phases (authorable, supportable, adoptable) successfully discriminate between tools and reveal meaningful patterns.


### 7.2. highest leverage pattern: declarations × repos

tools that codify knowledge into inheritable declarations (declapract, declapract-ts-ehmpathy) achieve the highest effective leverage due to the **repo multiplier**.

```
effective_leverage = absolute_gain × frequency × compound × N_repos
```


### 7.3. frequency matters as much as gain

type-fns (4x effective) may provide comparable total value to dynamodb-dao-generator (30x effective) due to higher frequency of use.

```
total_value = effective_leverage × usage_frequency_per_day
```


### 7.4. supportable is the differentiator

most tools score high on authorable (9+) and adoptable (8+). supportable (7.5-9.7) varies most, suggesting it's the hardest to get right.


### 7.5. terms validated through practice

using leverage.authorable, leverage.supportable, leverage.adoptable in evaluation narratives felt natural and expressive. the terms are ready for ubiquitous language adoption.

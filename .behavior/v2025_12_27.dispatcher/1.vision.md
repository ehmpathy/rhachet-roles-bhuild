1. new role called `dispatcher`, next to `behaver`

2. briefs researched and declared for dispatcher on the best industry practices (w/ metrics and citations as always) on
   1. prioritization
   2. coordination (dependency management)

  for the goal of throughput maximization, under resource constraints (today, only resource constraints are human reviewer time)
  after this, we HOPE our resource constraint will become token utilization, as the human reviewer will always be ahead of the workers (due to robot:review virtuous cycle && prioritization of leverage that will unlock that)

  3. briefs on `leverage` work (e.g., devtools) ; -> work that makes work go faster
     1. and how that balances against `product` work -> work that produces effect

  - specifically briefs should include
    - how to measure gain of work (direct, dependent, probabalistic (e.g., % chance of success vs % chance of magnitude & band of range)); also, one way vs two way decisions, etc (sweater:1day-pain, haircut:2week-pain, tatoo:perma-pain)
    - how to measure cost of work (time, money, trust, etc) (hidden && direct, etc)

  - also, how to parallelize and maximize throughput under resource constraints & dependent workstreams

  - basically, briefs on all scopes of knowledge that can be researched that have relevance to this role & its skills

  - see https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhrain/blob/main/src/roles/thinker/briefs/knowledge for how to distill knoweldge as briefs. we want to keep these frames


3. the <prioritize> and <coordinate> skills implemented, like the other skills in this repo
   1. but, more like https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhrain/blob/main/src/roles/reviewer/skills/review/review.ts has been implemented
   2. we want to have a .sh -> .ts entrypoint, with the domain.operations decomposed under @src/domain.operations & @src/domain.objects
   3. full integration and unit test coverage
      1. all boundaries integration test covered
      2. all end2endflows integration test covered
      3. all domain logic unit test covered

then, we should be able to call

`npx rhachet run --repo bhuild --skill prioritize --source rhachet.dispatch.yml --output ./.dispatch`

where the dispatch.yml will enumerate all of the sources to look for behaviors in
- local git repo dirs
- cloud git repo urls

and output specifies the dir to write the outputs into

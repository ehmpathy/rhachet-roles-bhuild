> why not use S4 ? also, can we estimate
leverage.support.time in the same way we do with
leverage.author.time ? (by gut + by decomposed + average) ?


# blocker.2

> also, lets add an intro section which explains why all
  leverage boils down to time in software; i.e., time is the
  fundamental unit - even physically - as energy is just time
  via entropy

# blocker.3

dont foget to specify the polarity of the metrics in
section 2. raw measurements from v7



# blocker.4

> review the doc foc consistency and fulfillment of the
objective; leverage.support and leverage.author should be
treated symetrically (define how to get a composite metric
for each); then, we must define how to get a composite metric
 across the two to get an ultimate composite leverage metric



# blocker.5
  > also, include a treestruct at the top which shows how the
  different subdimensions of leverage are nested

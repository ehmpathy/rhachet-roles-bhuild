# research: leverage measurement across domains (v2)

this document extends leverage research beyond software engineering to physics, mechanics, finance, biology, ecology, economics, and systems thinking — seeking fundamental principles that transcend domain-specific artifacts.

## 1. physics: mechanical leverage


### 1.1. mechanical advantage

> "mechanical advantage is a measure of the force amplification attained by a machine."
> — [wikipedia, mechanical advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage)

> "the ideal mechanical advantage equals the length of the effort arm divided by the length of the resistance arm of a lever."
> — [openstax physics, 9.3 simple machines](https://openstax.org/books/physics/pages/9-3-simple-machines)

**core formula:**
```
mechanical_advantage = output_force / input_force
                    = effort_arm_length / load_arm_length
```

**key insight:** leverage is a RATIO of output to input, determined by physical geometry (arm lengths).


### 1.2. archimedes' law of the lever

> "give me a lever (long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it), and I shall move the world."
> — archimedes, 3rd century BC

> "effort multiplied by the length of the effort arm is equal to the load multiplied by the length of the load arm — meaning that the longer the effort end, the less the force required to raise the load."
> — [nyu, archimedes' law of the lever](https://math.nyu.edu/Archimedes/Lever/LeverLaw.html)

**formula (archimedes):**
```
effort × effort_arm = load × load_arm

rearranged:
effort = load × (load_arm / effort_arm)
```

**key insight:** leverage allows LESS effort to move MORE load by changing the RATIO of distances.

**citation [1]:** [archimedes' law of the lever, nyu math](https://math.nyu.edu/Archimedes/Lever/LeverLaw.html)


### 1.3. classes of levers

> "class II levers have the resistance (or load) located between the effort and the fulcrum... since the load arm is smaller than the effort arm, the lever's mechanical advantage is always greater than 1. it is also called a force multiplier lever."
> — [wikipedia, lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever)

| class | configuration | MA | example |
|-------|---------------|-------|---------|
| I | fulcrum between effort and load | varies | seesaw, scissors |
| II | load between fulcrum and effort | > 1 | wheelbarrow, nutcracker |
| III | effort between fulcrum and load | < 1 | tweezers, human arm |

**key insight:** different lever configurations trade force for speed/distance.

**citation [2]:** [wikipedia, lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever)


### 1.4. conservation principle

> "the equations show how a simple machine can output the same amount of work while reducing the amount of effort force by increasing the distance over which the effort force is applied."
> — [openstax physics](https://openstax.org/books/physics/pages/9-3-simple-machines)

**fundamental law:**
```
work_in = work_out
effort × effort_distance = load × load_distance
```

**key insight:** leverage does NOT create energy — it TRANSFORMS input (less force × more distance) into output (more force × less distance). total work is conserved.

**citation [3]:** [openstax physics, 9.3 simple machines](https://openstax.org/books/physics/pages/9-3-simple-machines)

## 2. biomechanics: anatomical leverage


### 2.1. muscle-bone lever systems

> "bones, ligaments, and muscles are the structures that form levers in the body to create human movement. in simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance."
> — [human kinetics](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/levers-work-to-create-movement-in-the-human-body)

> "lever systems provide a mechanical advantage to either multiply the output force of a muscle at the expense of decreased speed and output distance or divide the input force to increase the distance and speed produced by the muscle."
> — [visiblebody, biomechanics](https://www.visiblebody.com/blog/biomechanics-lever-systems-in-the-body)

**key insight:** biological systems use the same leverage principles as mechanical systems — trading force for speed/range.

**citation [4]:** [human kinetics, levers work to create movement](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/levers-work-to-create-movement-in-the-human-body)


### 2.2. movement amplification

> "muscles can only contract a short distance, but since they are attached near a joint, the movement at the opposite end of a limb is greatly increased. the biceps muscle of the arm may contract only 89 to 90 mm, but the hand will move about 60 cm."
> — [human anatomy and physiology, louis pressbooks](https://louis.pressbooks.pub/humananatomyandphysiology1/chapter/12-biomechanics/)

**ratio:**
```
hand_movement / muscle_contraction = 600mm / 90mm ≈ 6.7x amplification
```

**key insight:** biological leverage amplifies SMALL inputs into LARGE outputs through geometric arrangement.

**citation [5]:** [human anatomy and physiology, biomechanics](https://louis.pressbooks.pub/humananatomyandphysiology1/chapter/12-biomechanics/)


---


## 3. finance: financial leverage


### 3.1. debt-to-equity leverage

> "the debt-to-equity ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to shareholder equity. it shows how much debt is used to finance operations compared to owner's funds."
> — [corporate finance institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/debt-to-equity-ratio-formula/)

**formula:**
```
financial_leverage = total_debt / shareholders_equity
```

**interpretation:**
- leverage = 0.5 → $0.50 debt per $1.00 equity
- leverage = 1.0 → $1.00 debt per $1.00 equity (equal)
- leverage = 2.0 → $2.00 debt per $1.00 equity

**key insight:** financial leverage uses BORROWED assets to control MORE assets than you own.

**citation [6]:** [corporate finance institute, debt to equity ratio](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/debt-to-equity-ratio-formula/)


### 3.2. operating leverage

> "the operating leverage measures the proportion of a company's cost structure that consists of fixed costs rather than variable costs."
> — [wall street prep, operating leverage](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/operating-leverage/)

> "companies with high operating leverage have a higher proportion of fixed costs in their total cost structure, which means beyond the breakeven volume, a small increase in sales can lead to a significant increase in operating income."
> — [wall street prep](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/operating-leverage/)

**formula:**
```
degree_of_operating_leverage = % change in operating income / % change in revenue
```

**key insight:** high fixed costs create leverage — small revenue changes cause LARGE profit changes.

**citation [7]:** [wall street prep, operating leverage](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/operating-leverage/)


### 3.3. return on investment (ROI)

> "ROI is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment by comparing its gain or loss relative to its cost."
> — [corporate finance institute, ROI](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/return-on-investment-roi-formula/)

**formula:**
```
ROI = (gain - cost) / cost × 100%
```

**key insight:** ROI is fundamentally a leverage ratio — output (gain) relative to input (cost).

**citation [8]:** [corporate finance institute, return on investment](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/return-on-investment-roi-formula/)


---


## 4. economics: multiplier effects


### 4.1. keynesian fiscal multiplier

> "the fiscal multiplier is the ratio of change in national income arising from a change in government spending. when this multiplier exceeds one, the enhanced effect on national income may be called the multiplier effect."
> — [wikipedia, fiscal multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier)

> "a multiplier of 1.5 means that for every additional $1 the government spends, GDP is boosted by a larger amount ($1.50)."
> — [corporate finance institute, keynesian multiplier](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/keynesian-multiplier/)

**formula:**
```
multiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC)

where MPC = marginal propensity to consume
```

**example:**
- MPC = 0.8 → multiplier = 1/(1-0.8) = 5.0
- $1 spent → $5 GDP impact

**key insight:** economic leverage arises from CASCADING effects — each dollar spent becomes income that is spent again.

**citation [9]:** [wikipedia, fiscal multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier)
**citation [10]:** [corporate finance institute, keynesian multiplier](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/keynesian-multiplier/)


### 4.2. network effects (metcalfe's law)

> "metcalfe's law states that the financial value or influence of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n²)."
> — [wikipedia, metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law)

> "so 10 users create roughly 100 units of value. scale to 100 users and you get 10,000 units of value — that's 100 times the value from a 10x increase in users."
> — [peter fisk, metcalfe's law](https://www.peterfisk.com/2020/02/metcalfes-law-explains-how-the-value-of-networks-grow-exponentially-there-are-5-types-of-network-effects/)

**formula:**
```
network_value ∝ n²
```

**key insight:** network leverage is SUPERLINEAR — doubling users quadruples value.

**citation [11]:** [wikipedia, metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law)


### 4.3. compound interest

> "compound interest is a powerful financial concept that has the potential to grow your wealth exponentially over time. simply put, compound interest is the interest earned on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest of an investment."
> — [medium, power of compound interest](https://medium.com/@Xanconconi/the-exponential-growth-of-compound-interest-8d8cc2e5af49)

**formula:**
```
A = P(1 + r)ⁿ
```

**rule of 72:**
```
years_to_double ≈ 72 / interest_rate
```

**key insight:** compound leverage comes from RECURSIVE application — returns generate more returns.

**citation [12]:** [medium, exponential growth of compound interest](https://medium.com/@Xanconconi/the-exponential-growth-of-compound-interest-8d8cc2e5af49)

## 5. ecology: disproportionate influence


### 5.1. keystone species

> "keystone species are defined as 'one whose impact on its community or ecosystem is large, and disproportionately large relative to its abundance.'"
> — [national geographic, role of keystone species](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/role-keystone-species-ecosystem/)

> "the role that a keystone species plays in its ecosystem is analogous to the role of a keystone in an arch. while the keystone is under the least pressure of any of the stones in an arch, the arch still collapses without it."
> — [national geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/role-keystone-species-ecosystem/)

**key insight:** ecological leverage = DISPROPORTIONATE impact relative to size/biomass.

**citation [13]:** [national geographic, keystone species](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/role-keystone-species-ecosystem/)


### 5.2. trophic cascades

> "remove a keystone predator, and the population of creatures it once hunted can explode, pushing out other organisms and reducing species diversity. this domino effect is known as a trophic cascade."
> — [nrdc, keystone species 101](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/keystone-species-101)

**example (yellowstone wolves):**
> "lacking an apex predator, elk populations in yellowstone exploded. elk herds competed for food resources, and plants such as grasses, sedges, and reeds did not have time or space to grow. overgrazing influenced the populations of other species, such as fish, beaver, and songbirds."
> — [nrdc](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/keystone-species-101)

**key insight:** ecological leverage creates CASCADING effects across trophic levels.

**citation [14]:** [nrdc, keystone species 101](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/keystone-species-101)

## 6. systems thinking: leverage points


### 6.1. donella meadows' twelve leverage points

> "leverage points are 'places within a complex system (a corporation, an economy, a living body, a city, an ecosystem) where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything.'"
> — [donella meadows project](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)

**hierarchy (least to most effective):**
1. constants, parameters, numbers
2. buffer sizes relative to flows
3. structure of stocks and flows
4. lengths of delays
5. strength of negative feedback loops
6. gain around positive feedback loops
7. structure of information flows
8. rules of the system
9. power to self-organize
10. goals of the system
11. mindset or paradigm
12. power to transcend paradigms

**key insight:** leverage points vary in EFFECTIVENESS — deeper systemic changes create more leverage than parameter tweaks.

**citation [15]:** [donella meadows project, leverage points](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)


### 6.2. paradigm leverage

> "as you move up dana's list of leverage points from #12 to #1, they become increasingly fundamental and increasingly likely to create large and lasting changes in the functioning of a system. goals, mindsets, and paradigms sit at the very top of the hierarchy of leverage points."
> — [systems thinking alliance](https://systemsthinkingalliance.org/transforming-systems-with-leverage-points-insights-and-critiques-and-future-directions/)

**key insight:** the highest leverage is in changing HOW people THINK, not what they do.

**citation [16]:** [systems thinking alliance, leverage points in system transformation](https://systemsthinkingalliance.org/transforming-systems-with-leverage-points-insights-and-critiques-and-future-directions/)

## 7. thermodynamics: efficiency limits


### 7.1. carnot efficiency

> "the carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. the efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates."
> — [wikipedia, carnot heat engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine)

**formula:**
```
η_carnot = 1 - T_cold / T_hot
```

**key insight:** thermodynamic leverage is bounded by PHYSICAL LIMITS — no engine can exceed carnot efficiency.

**citation [17]:** [wikipedia, carnot heat engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine)


### 7.2. efficiency as ratio

> "efficiency (η) is the ratio of the work done by the engine (to the surroundings) to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir (to the engine)."
> — [physics libretexts, carnot engine](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/College_Physics/College_Physics_1e_(OpenStax)/15:_Thermodynamics/15.04:_Carnots_Perfect_Heat_Engine-_The_Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_Restated)

**formula:**
```
efficiency = work_output / heat_input
```

**key insight:** efficiency is fundamentally a leverage ratio — useful output relative to total input.

**citation [18]:** [physics libretexts, carnot's perfect heat engine](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/College_Physics/College_Physics_1e_(OpenStax)/15:_Thermodynamics/15.04:_Carnots_Perfect_Heat_Engine-_The_Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_Restated)

## 8. biochemistry: catalytic leverage


### 8.1. enzyme efficiency

> "enzymes accelerate the rates of such reactions by well over a million-fold, so reactions that would take years in the absence of catalysis can occur in fractions of seconds if catalyzed by the appropriate enzyme."
> — [ncbi bookshelf, the cell](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9921/)

> "enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction."
> — [ncbi bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9921/)

**key insight:** catalytic leverage = MASSIVE rate amplification (10⁶+) without consuming the catalyst.

**citation [19]:** [ncbi bookshelf, enzymes as biological catalysts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9921/)


### 8.2. catalytic efficiency metric

> "kcat/KM is thought of as a measure of enzyme efficiency. this ratio is important because it allows direct comparison of the effectiveness of an enzyme."
> — [chemistry libretexts, catalytic efficiency](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biological_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Biological_Chemistry)/Enzymes/Enzymatic_Kinetics/Catalytic_Efficiency_of_Enzymes)

**formula:**
```
catalytic_efficiency = kcat / Km
```

where:
- kcat = turnover number (reactions per second)
- Km = substrate concentration for half-max velocity

**key insight:** enzyme leverage is measured as reactions catalyzed per unit time relative to binding affinity.

**citation [20]:** [chemistry libretexts, catalytic efficiency of enzymes](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biological_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Biological_Chemistry)/Enzymes/Enzymatic_Kinetics/Catalytic_Efficiency_of_Enzymes)

## 9. manufacturing: learning curves


### 9.1. wright's law

> "wright found that every time total aircraft production doubled, the required labor time for a new aircraft fell by 20%. this has become known as 'wright's law.'"
> — [wikipedia, experience curve effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects)

> "each time the cumulative production doubled, cost declined by a fixed percentage. in the aircraft industry, at that time, this reduction was about 20%."
> — [strategosinc, learning curves](http://www.strategosinc.com/RESOURCES/02-Strategy/learning_curves.htm)

**formula:**
```
cost_n = cost_1 × n^(-b)

where b = log(learning_rate) / log(2)
```

**key insight:** manufacturing leverage increases with CUMULATIVE EXPERIENCE — each doubling reduces cost by a fixed percentage.

**citation [21]:** [wikipedia, experience curve effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects)
**citation [22]:** [strategosinc, learning curves in manufacturing](http://www.strategosinc.com/RESOURCES/02-Strategy/learning_curves.htm)

## 10. efficiency metrics: power-to-weight


### 10.1. power-to-weight ratio

> "power to weight ratio refers to the amount of power an object generates relative to its weight. it is typically expressed as watts per kilogram (W/kg) or horsepower per pound (hp/lb) and is a crucial factor in determining acceleration, efficiency, and overall performance."
> — [wikipedia, power-to-weight ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio)

**formula:**
```
power_to_weight = power / weight
```

**key insight:** this ratio measures how much OUTPUT you get per unit of INPUT (mass to move).

**citation [23]:** [wikipedia, power-to-weight ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio)


---


## 11. pareto principle: asymmetric leverage


### 11.1. the 80/20 rule

> "the pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the 'vital few')."
> — [wikipedia, pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

> "in computer science the pareto principle can be applied to optimization efforts. for example, microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated."
> — [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

**key insight:** leverage is ASYMMETRIC — a small portion of inputs generates a large portion of outputs.

**citation [24]:** [wikipedia, pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

## 12. synthesis: universal leverage principles


### 12.1. the fundamental formula

across ALL domains, leverage follows the same pattern:

```
leverage = output / input
```

| domain | output | input | leverage_formula |
|--------|--------|-------|------------------|
| physics | output_force | input_force | F_out / F_in |
| finance | total_assets | own_equity | assets / equity |
| economics | GDP_change | spending_change | ΔGDP / Δspending |
| thermodynamics | work_done | heat_absorbed | W / Q |
| biology | reaction_rate | catalyst_amount | rate / [enzyme] |
| manufacturing | productivity | cumulative_experience | output / hours |


### 12.2. universal properties of leverage

from cross-domain analysis, leverage has these universal properties:

| property | description | examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **ratio** | always output relative to input | MA = F_out/F_in |
| **conservation** | total work/energy/value is preserved | work_in = work_out |
| **tradeoffs** | gaining one thing costs another | force vs distance |
| **bounds** | physical or logical limits exist | carnot efficiency |
| **cascades** | leverage can compound transitively | trophic cascades, multiplier effect |
| **asymmetry** | small causes → large effects | keystone species, pareto |
| **geometry** | physical arrangement determines ratio | lever arm lengths |


### 12.3. what leverage is NOT

based on this research, leverage is NOT:

| misconception | reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "more output" | leverage is a RATIO, not absolute output |
| "free energy" | leverage TRANSFORMS input, doesn't create it |
| "lines of code" | arbitrary metric, no physical basis |
| "velocity" | speed is effect, not leverage itself |
| "productivity" | productivity is output; leverage is output/input |


### 12.4. the effort-reduction framing

the most intuitive framing across domains is:

```
leverage = effort_before / effort_after
         = input_without_leverage / input_with_leverage
```

**interpretation:**
- leverage = 2.0 → half the effort required for same output
- leverage = 5.0 → 1/5th the effort required for same output
- leverage = 10.0 → 1/10th the effort required for same output

this matches:
- physics: less force needed with longer lever arm
- finance: less equity needed to control same assets
- biology: less time needed with enzyme present
- manufacturing: less labor needed with more experience

## 14. implications for dispatcher leverage model


### 14.1. validated core formula

the research validates the effort-reduction formula:

```
leverage = effort_before / effort_after
```

this is consistent across:
- physics (force reduction via lever arm)
- finance (equity reduction via debt)
- manufacturing (labor reduction via experience)
- biology (time reduction via catalyst)


### 14.2. domain objects

based on cross-domain analysis:

```ts
interface Leverage {
  // the fundamental ratio
  ratio: number;  // effort_before / effort_after

  // what is being reduced (input type)
  inputType: 'force' | 'time' | 'money' | 'attention' | 'effort';

  // mechanism creating the leverage
  mechanism: 'geometry' | 'debt' | 'experience' | 'catalyst' | 'network' | 'cascade';
}
```


### 14.3. domain operations

```
measureLeverage(before: Effort, after: Effort): Leverage
  → computes ratio of effort reduction

estimateLeverage(behavior: Behavior, dimension: 'maintenance' | 'velocity'): Leverage
  → predicts leverage a behavior will provide

composeLeverage(leverages: Leverage[]): Leverage
  → combines multiple leverage sources (multiplicative for independent, additive for overlapping)
```


### 14.4. key principles to apply

1. **leverage is always a ratio** — never absolute value
2. **conservation applies** — leverage transforms, doesn't create
3. **leverage has bounds** — carnot-like limits exist
4. **leverage cascades** — small changes can have large downstream effects
5. **leverage is asymmetric** — 20% of behaviors may provide 80% of leverage
6. **leverage depends on structure** — like lever arm geometry, system architecture determines leverage potential

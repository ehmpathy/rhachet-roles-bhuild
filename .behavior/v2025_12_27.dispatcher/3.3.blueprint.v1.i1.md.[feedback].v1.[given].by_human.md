first, bootup your mechanics briefs again

# blocker.1

 why did you claim these briefs as seeds? also, where's the
research phase demanded by the criteria?  review
.behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/2.criteria.md and
.behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/2.criteria.blackbox.md and
fix this blueprint

# blocker.2


  domain.operations/
    behavior/
      # gather operations

instead of just specifying the subdomains of behavior operations via comments

actually nest them into dirs with that same domain label

i.e.,

behavior/gather
behavior/deptrace
behavior/measure
etc...

# blocker.3

instead of inline


export const getOneBehaviorDeptraced = withSimpleCacheOnDisk(...insides...)

  pattern,


use the private/public export pattern

e.g.,


const _getOneBehaviorDeptraced = ...insides...

&&


export const getOneBehaviorDeptraced = withSimpleCacheOnDisk(_getOneBehaviorDeptraced)

# blocker.4

no need for

**contracts** (in `contract/cmd/`) are user-facing, agnostic of contentHash:

and no need for as-command


instead, those contracts should be in `contract/cli`

and the skill .sh files should invoke against contract/cli directly (rather than against .cli.ts)

# blocker.5


    // convert to refs for downstream operation
    const refs = gathered.map((g) => ({
      behavior: g.behavior,
      contentHash: g.contentHash,
    }));


this can use the native domain-objects RefByUnique.as<typeof BehaviorGathered>({ behavior, contentHash }) to maximize clarity and type guarantees

# blocker.6

eliminate manual verification steps; no manual verifications; all testsed via integration tests; both in blueprint and roadmap

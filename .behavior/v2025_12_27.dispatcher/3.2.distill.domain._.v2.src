distill the declastruct domain.objects and domain.operations that would
- enable fulfillment of
  - this wish .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/0.wish.md
  - this vision .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/1.vision.md
  - this criteria.of.blackbox .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/2.criteria.blackbox.md
  - this criteria.of.blueprint .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/2.criteria.md
- given the research declared here
  - .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.1.research.domain._.v1.i1.md (if declared)

procedure
1. declare the usecases and envision the contract that would be used to fulfill the usecases
2. declare the domain.objects, domain.operations, and access.daos that would fulfill this, via the declastruct pattern in this repo

note
- leverage the feedback that was emitted for the v1 version of the doc
- but start from scratch to ensure its a full thorough and coherent domain distillation, with the latest info

emit into
- .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/3.2.distill.domain._.v2.i1.md

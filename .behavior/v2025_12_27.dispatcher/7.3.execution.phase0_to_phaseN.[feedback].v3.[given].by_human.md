export interface BehaviorGathered {
  gatheredAt: string;
  behavior: RefByUnique<typeof Behavior>;
  contentHash: string;
  status: BehaviorGatheredStatus;
  files: BehaviorGatheredFile[];
  wish: string | null;
  vision: string | null;
  criteria: string | null;
  /**
   * .what = where this behavior was gathered from
   * .why = enables tracing behavior origin with full metadata
   */
  source: BehaviorGatheredSource;
}


wish, vision, and criteria should not be part of BehaviorGathered

 BehaviorGathered should NOT have the contents persisted with it

that way we can have many BehaviorGathered objects in memory without needing the full contents.

 operations that need the contents should just run `.get` on the BehaviorGatheredFile; also, why do we have a separate BehaviorGatheredFile[] rather than just RefByUnique<typeof GitFile>[] ?

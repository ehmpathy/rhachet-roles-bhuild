# blocker.1

  > BehaviorMeasuredYieldage, BehaviorMeasuredLeverage
  > namespace them properly


# blocker.2

BehaviorMeasuredLeverage => BehaviorMeasuredGainLeverage,
attend: number; => BehaviorMeasuredCostAttend

# blocker.3

namespace all domain objects appropriately. e.g., wtf is this


  /**
   * triage dimensions
   */
  dimensions: {
    /**
     * readiness level: now | soon | later | blocked
     * based on dependency status
     */
    readiness: ReadinessLevel;
    /**
     * bandwidth level: now | soon | later
     * based on concurrency constraints
     */
    bandwidth: BandwidthLevel;
  };

  /**
   * decision = min(readiness, bandwidth)
   * determines urgency bucket
   */
  decision: UrgencyLevel;

  /**
   * priority from measurement (carried forward)
   */
  priority: PriorityLevel;


UrgencyLeveL? appliees to all domains on earth? i think not. namespace it

review the full doc and fix all violations

# blocker.4

add a behaver/briefs rule under practices/behavior.distill to detect these types of violations at blocker level, so we dont repeat this in the future

e.g., rule with name something along the lines of namespaced domain.objects

# blocker.5

declare a DomainEntity for Behavior

declare a unique key on it

then, in other domain objects that reference it, reference it via RefByUnique<typeof Behavior>

e.g.,

from


interface BehaviorMeasured {
  /**
   * reference to deptraced behavior
   */
  ref: string;


into


interface BehaviorMeasured {
  /**
   * reference to the measured behavior
   */
  behavior: RefByUnique<typeof Behavior>;


that way, its clear which domain entities are being referenced and how. that way, our types guarantee that if a unique shape key is updated the effect will be casecaded throughout all references, too

# blocker.1

lets look at 0.wish(.*)?.md, 1.vision(.*)?.md, same for
 criteria; lets also have it look at the blueprint files
specifically. reason = we may decomposes wishes visions and
blueprints. exclude any files that have `[feedback]` in the
path though

when gatering the file contents


# blocker.2

 update the behavior status to be in terms of
'wished', 'envisioned', 'constrained' (if criteria),
'blueprinted' (if blueprint), 'inflight' (if execution files
exist), and 'delivered' (if delivered flag exists)

# blocker.3

add unit tests coverage on the behavior file paths taht we
gather and on the status operation

# blocker.1

doesn't getOneBehaviorDeptraced need the full basket of gathered behaviors in order to be able to find which behaviors it depends on?

or are we able to say that the dispatcher will be told to look at the .gathered/latest/ dir to find any deps that they may need on their own?

(lets say that actually) (it should be able to define that its dependent on a behavior that hasn't been gathered yet, too; we'll want test coverage on that. make it clear via comments tha this is a key criteria - and add it to the .behavior/v2025_12_27.dispatcher/2.criteria.md doc)

should declare domain.operations as


getAllBehaviorPrioritized({
  over: { behaviors: RefByUnique<typeof BehaviorGathered>[] },

and

getAllBehaviorCoordinated
  over: { behaviors: RefByUnique<typeof BehaviorGathered>[] },


and then separately the contracts of

getAllBehaviorPrioritized({
  by: BehaviorDispatchConfig
})
getAllBehaviorCoordinated({
  by: BehaviorDispatchConfig
})

and etc

so that the contracts can be agnostic of what the latest content hash is

and instead just invoke gather for the user first

and always operate on the latest;

but the domain.operations inside must operate per specific BehaviorGathered with version, to leverage caches

show how prioritize and coordinate can be run repeatedly
and - if no changes, produces same result idempotently - but
when has changes, shows progress. also, add criteria that we
.archive the old results as we invalidate them (i.e., move to
 .archive dir w/ .$timestamp.bak.md)


----

also, update the 2.criteria.md to declare dimensions of cost,
  like it declares dimensions of gain; cost can probably best
  be measured in terms of - how complicated is it, how testable
  the feedback loop is (i.e., human required? needs new test
  framework? reuses existing?)

what are the best dimensions to measure cost against?


---

review workstream with highest (priority × yieldage) ;
priority should have already considered yieldage and leverage
 before being written; we should simply be able to look a t
priority label



---

also, the measure skill should label that priorty already
too - and the coordinate skill should be able to just
leverage that; priority is not relative, its absolute;
multiple things can be at the same priority level

---

 we should separately have a _rank_ which specifies which
priorities are most important. that should be assigned at the
 workstream level. the rank declares the relative order of
importance
